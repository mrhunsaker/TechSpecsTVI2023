  abstract = {Playing games is an important way to promote the integration, inclusion, and socialization of participants. This is especially
             the case of persons with disabilities, such as visually impaired people. Unfortunately, very few games are accessible to such
             persons. Hopefully, in many digital games, this accessibility can be enabled in principle by assistive technologies, such as
             screen readers. The aim of this work consists in reviewing the recent literature on game accessibility for people with visual
             impairment and discussing benefits, limitations, and possible improvements of currently available accessibility solutions.
             After providing a definition of visual impairment and describing its relationship with gaming, the work reviews general
             techniques for designing more accessible games. Subsequently, it focuses on specific techniques based on replacing visual
             stimuli with auditory stimuli (e.g., sonification and sound-source simulation), also presenting some recently proposed
             sonification-mapping strategies. Then, the application of machine-learning techniques to the development of accessible
             interfaces for online versions of board games is illustrated by a recent case study. Finally, a discussion and some conclusions
             are provided, with a particular focus on policy implications of improvements in game accessibility for visually impaired
             people.},
