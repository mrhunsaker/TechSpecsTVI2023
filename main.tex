In the pursuit of an inclusive and equitable educational landscape, it is imperative to recognize the unique challenges faced by students with visual impairments. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) of 2004\footnote{\href{https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statuteregulations/}{20 U.S.C. ยง 1400, et.}} underscores the commitment to providing every student with a free and appropriate education, regardless of their abilities. For students with visual impairments, technology plays a pivotal role in dismantling barriers, fostering independence, and unlocking opportunities for academic success.

This document seeks to delve into the critical importance of addressing the technology needs of students with visual impairments within the framework of IDEIA, which mandates that students with disabilities, including those with visual impairments, must be given access to assistive technology to ensure they can participate fully in the curriculum. Screen magnification is one such assistive technology that can help students with visual impairments access their free public education\footnote{\href{https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statuteregulations/}{ibid}}. The overarching goal is to shed light on the essential role that technology plays in not only accommodating these students but empowering them to thrive in educational environments. By understanding and meeting their specific technological requirements, we can bridge the accessibility gap, promote inclusivity, and ensure that visually impaired students receive the education they deserve.

It is evident that technology is not merely an auxiliary tool but a catalyst for educational equality. The integration of appropriate technology is fundamental to providing a level playing field, enabling visually impaired students to engage with educational content, interact with peers, and pursue academic excellence with the same vigor as their sighted counterparts.

Throughout this document, we will delve into the diverse spectrum of technological solutions available, ranging from adaptive devices to assistive software, and explore how these tools contribute to an enriched learning experience. By doing so, we aim to advocate for the comprehensive implementation of technology solutions that align with the principles of IDEIA, ensuring that the promise of a free and appropriate education extends to every student, regardless of their visual abilities\footnote{\href{https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statuteregulations/}{ibid}}.

In the dynamic landscape of education, technology stands as a powerful enabler, breaking down barriers and creating pathways for inclusivity. Nowhere is this more evident than in the realm of assistive technology designed for visually impaired students. Among the myriad tools at their disposal, screen readers and magnification programs emerge as keystones, indispensable in shaping an environment where success is not just attainable but expected.

For visually impaired students, these tools represent a digital gateway to a world of knowledge, interaction, and independent learning. This chapter endeavors to illuminate the significance of screen readers and magnification programs, highlighting their essential roles in fostering student success. As the educational landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial to recognize that the transformative power of technology is not a luxury but a necessity, especially for those whose access to information is mediated by visual impairments.

Screen readers, with their adept ability to convert digital text into synthesized speech, empower visually impaired students to engage with written content. As we delve into the intricacies of these tools, we will uncover their pivotal role in granting students access to textbooks, online resources, and educational materials that are the bedrock of academic achievement. Simultaneously, magnification programs play a crucial role in enhancing visual content, allowing students to explore images, charts, and diagrams with a level of detail that might otherwise be elusive.

Screen magnification is another crucial tool for students with visual impairments, as it enables them to access text and other visual content in the classroom.  By magnifying the text and images on the screen, students can read and view the content more easily, which can help them keep up with their peers and achieve academic success. In this chapter, we will explore the importance of screen magnification for students with visual impairments and how it can help them access their free public education.

Through the lens of accessibility, this exploration seeks to underscore the imperative nature of these technologies, not as mere tools but as companions on the road to success for visually impaired students navigating the educational landscape.

\pagebreak \hypertarget{software-needs}{}\section{Vision Specific Software Needs}\label{software-needs}
As a student with visual impairments, accessing a free and appropriate public education can be challenging. However, with the help of special software, students can overcome these challenges and achieve academic success. Assistive Technology has improved the lives of students and adults living with visual impairments by providing access, connectedness, and engagement. The use of assistive technology can facilitate a learning environment where students are able to better access their educational program through low or high technology accommodations.

Incorporating special software can help students with visual impairments to access the same educational resources as their peers. It can also help them to learn at their own pace and in their own way. For instance, screen readers and magnification options built into mainstream tablets and smartphones can help students with visual impairments to read and write emails, texts, and documents.

In addition, technology can help students with visual impairments to become active learners. Traditional lectures may not be the optimal learning style for visually impaired students. However, hands-on engagement through technology can help them to better understand and complete assignments and tests2.

By using special software, students with visual impairments can have equal access to educational opportunities and can be better prepared for the real world. It can also help them to acquire the skills required for independent living and getting higher education.

\pagebreak\hypertarget{student-software-needs}{}\subsection{Student Software Needs}\label{student-software-needs}
Table \ref{tab:table1} is a list of software used to access material as well as necessary academic software used by students with visual impairments\footnote{We focus on Windows-based laptops due to the ubiquity of Windows-based software used in schools. MacOS-based laptops are more than adequate to run software along with the built in VoiceOver screenreader  To date there are no additional screenreaders for MacOS, however one is currently in development called \href{https://youtu.be/qTkS-zNzF88?si=3XTXtbyOWD9kvwlk}{VOSH}. There are multiple Linux distributions that are actively working to improve ORCA screenreader accessibility within the GNOME desktop environment. There are also a number of independently developed screenreaders for Linux architectures}\fnsep\footnote{This includes the TVI teaching how to use the software skills. But this primarily refers to programs the students need to access the curriculum}. This information will be used to determine necessary laptop specifications for students using these software to access their schoolwork at the same time as their sighted peers.

Table \ref{tab:table2} is a list of software used by Teachers of Students with Visual Impairments to generate materials for students with visual impairments\footnote{This includes everything from the above table in order to be able to teach the software}.

These software programs are often memory intensive and sometimes benefit from use of command-line tools originally developed for Linux or MacOS environments but are available in the Windows environment using tools such as the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

Having a computer with sufficient RAM and processor speed is crucial for the effective functioning of a screen reader, which serves as a vital assistive technology for individuals with visual impairments. A screen reader relies heavily on processing power and memory to rapidly convert textual information into synthesized speech or refreshable braille displays, allowing users to access and navigate digital content. A computer with inadequate RAM or a slow processor may struggle to process and relay information in real-time, resulting in delayed responses, sluggish navigation, and an overall compromised user experience. Insufficient hardware specifications can significantly hinder the screen reader's ability to provide timely and accurate information, rendering it an inadequate accommodation for individuals with visual impairments. Therefore, ensuring that the computer meets or exceeds the recommended RAM and processor speed is essential to guarantee an optimal and seamless user experience, empowering individuals with visual impairments to access and engage with digital content effectively.

Having a computer with sufficient RAM and an up-to-date processor is crucial for running a screenreader and screen magnifier smoothly as a student with visual impairments in order to receive a free and appropriate public education. Screenreaders and screen magnifiers are software applications that require a significant amount of processing power and memory to function properly. Insufficient RAM can cause the screenreader or screen magnifier to load slowly, which can lead to delays in the userโs workflow. An up-to-date processor is also important because it can help ensure that the software runs smoothly and efficiently. By having a computer with sufficient RAM and an up-to-date processor, students with visual impairments can access the same educational materials as their sighted peers and participate fully in the curriculum. This can help improve their academic performance and ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed in their studies and beyond.

In addition to having sufficient RAM and an up-to-date processor, it is also important to ensure that the computer is running the latest version of the screenreader and screen magnifier software. Software updates often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features that can help improve the user experience. By keeping the software up-to-date, students with visual impairments can ensure that they are getting the most out of their assistive technology. It is also important to ensure that the computer is free of malware and other malicious software that can slow down the system and interfere with the operation of the screenreader and screen magnifier. By taking these steps, students with visual impairments can ensure that their computer is running optimally and that they have the tools they need to succeed in their studies and beyond.

\pagebreak \hypertarget{screenreader-loading}{}\section{Screenreader Loading}\label{screenreader-loading}
The latency of a screenreader is the time it takes for the software to load and start functioning. It is important to measure the latency of a screenreader to determine if the laptop has sufficient RAM to run the software properly. Insufficient RAM can cause the screenreader to load slowly, which can lead to delays in the userโs workflow. Measuring the latency of a screenreader can help identify if the laptop has enough RAM to run the software smoothly. This can help users avoid frustration and improve their productivity. In addition to identifying insufficient RAM, measuring the latency of a screenreader can also help users identify if there are other issues with their laptop that may be causing the software to run slowly. For example, if the latency is still high even after upgrading the RAM, it could be an indication of a slow hard drive or outdated drivers. By measuring the latency of a screenreader, users can ensure that their laptop is running optimally and that they are getting the most out of their software. It is recommended to measure the latency of a screenreader periodically to ensure that the laptop is running smoothly and to identify any issues that may arise.

Figure \ref{fig:figure 1} shows a boxplot of the latency to load JAWS measured across the various student and professional computers I had access to. The student laptop generally took \textgreater2 minutes for JAWS to load, a higher spec student laptop took about 1 minute, and the professional laptops took under a minute\footnote{\href{https://github.com/mrhunsaker/MiscResources/raw/main/ComputerRBDisplaySpecsTVIFig1.zip}{Zipped Interactive HTML version of Figure \ref{fig:figure 1}}}.

\hypertarget{screenreader-response}{}\section{Screenreader Responsiveness}\label{screenreader-response}
Measuring the latency of a screenreader to respond to key presses is important to determine if the laptop has sufficient RAM to run the software properly. If the laptop has insufficient RAM, the screenreader may take longer to respond to key presses, which can lead to delays in the userโs workflow. Measuring the latency of a screenreader can help identify if the laptop has enough RAM to run the software smoothly. This can help users avoid frustration and improve their productivity. Additionally, measuring the latency of a screenreader can help users identify if there are other issues with their laptop that may be causing the software to run slowly. By measuring the latency of a screenreader, users can ensure that their laptop is running optimally and that they are getting the most out of their software.

\pagebreak \hypertarget{notes-on-future-proofing-laptops}{}\section{Laptop Cost Factors}\label{notes-on-future-proofing-laptops}
Students with visual impairments require laptops that are compatible with assistive technology to receive a free and accessible public education. When selecting a laptop, there are several cost factors that must be taken into account. Firstly, the laptop should have sufficient RAM to run the assistive technology software smoothly. Secondly, the laptop should have a high-quality screen that is large enough to display text and images clearly. Thirdly, the laptop should have a long battery life to ensure that students can use it for extended periods of time without needing to recharge. Fourthly, the laptop should have a durable build quality to withstand daily wear and tear. Finally, the laptop should be lightweight and portable to enable students to carry it around easily. These factors can help ensure that students with visual impairments have access to the technology they need to succeed in their studies.

\hypertarget{future-proofing}{}\section{Laptop Durability}\label{future-proofing}

I asked ChatGPT why we should consider future usage needs of a laptop into my purchasing plans and here is its response:

\begin{leftbar} \begin{quote}
		Buying laptops with high-end RAM and processor specifications can be beneficial for several reasons, especially in terms of longevity and performance. Here are some key considerations:

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

			\item
			      Future-Proofing:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      Investing in higher-end components can help future-proof your laptop to some extent. As software and applications become more demanding over time, a laptop with better specifications is likely to remain relevant and capable of handling new software updates and requirements.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{1}

			\item
			      Multitasking and Performance:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      Higher RAM allows for better multitasking capabilities. If you use resource-intensive applications or run multiple programs simultaneously, having ample RAM prevents slowdowns and ensures smooth performance.
			\item
			      A powerful processor can handle complex computations and tasks more efficiently, contributing to faster overall system performance.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{2}

			\item
			      Graphics Processing:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      For tasks such as video editing, gaming, or other graphics-intensive applications, a high-end GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is crucial. This is separate from RAM and the main processor but is equally important for certain tasks.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{3}

			\item
			      Long-Term Usability:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      Technology advances quickly, and what is considered high-end today might become standard or entry-level in a few years. However, starting with a high-end laptop gives you a more extended period before your system becomes outdated.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{4}

			\item
			      Smooth Upgrades:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      Some laptops allow users to upgrade certain components like RAM and storage. Starting with higher-end specifications provides more headroom for future upgrades, allowing you to extend the useful life of your laptop.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{5}

			\item
			      Resource-Intensive Applications:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      If you use applications that require a lot of processing power, like video editing software, 3D modeling tools, or virtualization software, a high-end laptop can handle these tasks more efficiently, providing a better user experience.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{6}

			\item
			      Responsiveness and Speed:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      A faster processor and more RAM contribute to a more responsive system. Applications load quicker, and the overall user experience is smoother, which can significantly impact productivity.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{7}

			\item
			      Enhanced Resale Value:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      High-end laptops generally retain their value better than lower-end models. If you decide to sell or upgrade your laptop in the future, having top-tier specifications can make it more attractive to potential buyers.
		\end{itemize}

		It's important to note that the specific requirements depend on your usage patterns and needs. Not everyone needs the highest specifications, and sometimes a mid-range laptop can be more than sufficient for everyday tasks. However, for users with demanding workloads or those who want a longer usable life from their device, opting for higher-end specifications can be a wise investment.

\pagebreak	\hypertarget{optimizing-cost-with-performance}{}\section{Laptop Cost Optimization}\label{optimizing-cost-with-performance}

There is an economic theory based on a Terry Pratchett novel that explains this phenomenon better than we can. It is called the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory}{Boots Theory}\footnote{Full Text (emphasis mine):
	\begin{leftbar}
		\begin{quote}The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

			Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

			But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. \textbf{A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots thatโd still be keeping his feet dry in ten yearsโ time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.}

			Basically, \textbf{we are destined to be stuck in a cycle of perpetually spending more money for inferior products and will, in the end, spend more money than if we just paid for better product in the first place.} -- \textit{Men At Arms}, page 38
		\end{quote}
	\end{leftbar} }

\hfill \break Table \ref{tab:table6} illustrates this theory in terms of student laptop computers (Assuming student has a laptop using a screenreader through 3rd-12th grade).

I put this Table \ref{tab:table6} here to illustrate why we choose to err on the side of spending \$2000-3000 now on a laptop that will last 3-5 years over spending \$1500-2000 on a laptop that will barely make it 1-2 years before becoming obsolete. By the end of 5 years we will have spent more on Low End and Mid Range Laptops than we would have had we purchased a High End Laptop. Importantly; however, we also would have been using laptops that always perform more poorly than a High End laptop would.

In an era where technology shapes the landscape of education, tablets have emerged as transformative tools, providing visually impaired students with unprecedented access to knowledge and fostering independence in their academic journeys\footnote{I am omitting iPhones and Android phones from this document as the purchase of student phones is beyond the purview of a scool district}. Within the realm of tablets, both iPad and Android devices stand as beacons of innovation, offering not only user-friendly interfaces but also a diverse array of applications specifically tailored to bridge the accessibility gap. This chapter embarks on a compelling exploration of how tablets, in tandem with purpose-built apps, are not just tools but catalysts for success in the educational odyssey of visually impaired students.

The tactile elegance of tablets goes beyond mere convenience; it represents a paradigm shift in the way students interact with information. For visually impaired learners, tablets serve as dynamic portals, offering a multi-sensory approach to engagement. Through the lens of this chapter, we will unravel the unique functionalities of both iPad and Android tablets, delving into their respective strengths and contributions to an inclusive educational experience.

Apps, the lifeblood of these devices, play an instrumental role in transforming tablets into personalized learning companions. From screen readers that convert text to speech with remarkable precision to magnification apps that enhance visual content, the ecosystem of applications available empowers visually impaired students to navigate the digital realm with confidence. Tablets, coupled with innovative apps, are not mere gadgets; they represent a dynamic force propelling visually impaired students toward success; underscoring the indispensable role these tools play in shaping an educational landscape where every student, regardless of visual abilities, can seize the opportunities that lie ahead.

\hypertarget{tablet-considerations}{}\section{Tablet Considerations}\label{tab:tablelet-considerations}

When selecting a tablet for students with visual impairments to access their schoolwork, careful consideration must be given to the device's accessibility features to ensure an inclusive and conducive learning environment. Essential considerations include the tablet's compatibility with screen readers and magnification tools, ensuring that these assistive technologies seamlessly integrate with the device's operating system. Additionally, evaluating the availability and effectiveness of built-in accessibility features such as VoiceOver for iOS or TalkBack for Android is crucial\footnote{Traditionally, assistive technology for the blind has focused on the iPad line since the Android line had historically lagged behind the Apple products for accessibility features prior to 2020 so accessibility apps have favored the iOS/iPadOS architecture. However, groups are emerging that specifically instruct users of Android devices how to access and use accessibility settings \textit{cf.}, \href{https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvEM-SmpwElNALldhp8hG1g}{Blind Android Users}}. The tablet's tactile features, size, and weight should also be taken into account to accommodate students' specific needs. High contrast and customizable color settings, as well as text-to-speech functionalities, are vital components that enhance readability. Furthermore, the tablet's compatibility with a variety of educational apps designed with accessibility in mind is paramount. By prioritizing these considerations, educators and administrators can empower students with visual impairments to engage with their schoolwork independently and efficiently, fostering a more inclusive learning experience.

One frequently overlooked challenge in using tablets for individuals with visual impairments is the potential for visual fatigue. Recent research, such as the study by Pakdee and Sengsoon (2021)\footnote{\textit{cf}., \href{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352764109_Immediate_Effects_of_Different_Screen_Sizes_on_Visual_Fatigue_in_Video_Display_Terminal_Users}{Pakdee, S., \& Sengsoon, P. (2021). Immediate Effects of Different Screen Sizes on Visual Fatigue in Video Display Terminal Users. \textit{Iranian Rehabilitation Journal, 19(2)}, 137-1461. DOI:10.32598/irj.19.2.1108.2}}, reveals that opting for a slightly larger device can mitigate visual fatigue, particularly for those engaged in visually demanding tasks. This consideration becomes even more pertinent for individuals with visual impairments.

While the iPad Pro2 and Samsung Galaxy Tab 9 tablets are often lauded for their increased brightness, it's crucial not to prioritize brightness as a major factor. Research suggests that boosting brightness can exacerbate visual fatigue. Instead, emphasis should be placed on the larger screen's enhanced resolution and expanded visual area, facilitating efficient use of Zoom functions. This becomes especially significant when aiming to teach students to adeptly navigate assistive technology without relying solely on pinch zooming, a feature that may not consistently function within all applications.

Another critical consideration involves contrast ratios. For students with photophobia, adjusting luminance levels to lower settings can significantly enhance clarity of text and images. This nuanced approach to tablet selection is pivotal in creating an accessible and comfortable learning environment for students with visual impairments.

For individuals with visual impairments, the efficacy of these devices relies heavily on factors that go beyond mere functionality. One crucial aspect that significantly impacts the accessibility of tablets for visually impaired students is the contrast ratio. The contrast ratio, representing the difference in luminance between the brightest and darkest elements on a screen, plays a pivotal role in ensuring that individuals with visual impairments can effectively engage with educational content. In a school setting, where tablets are increasingly utilized for various learning activities, understanding and prioritizing contrast ratio becomes paramount in fostering an inclusive and enriching educational environment for all students, regardless of their visual abilities.

In the intricate tapestry of education, the pursuit of literacy is a fundamental thread, weaving through the academic journey of every student. For visually impaired learners, the path to literacy takes on a unique character, one in which the tactile elegance of braille becomes a vital conduit to knowledge. Within this narrative, refreshable braille displays emerge as indispensable companions, unlocking the doors to literacy, fostering engagement, and propelling students toward academic success. This chapter embarks on a compelling exploration of how refreshable braille displays are not merely tools but keystones in the quest for literacy and educational achievement among visually impaired students.

At the heart of this exploration lies the transformative power of refreshable braille displaysโa technological marvel that seamlessly integrates the tactile richness of braille with the dynamic capabilities of digital communication. This chapter delves into the ergonomic design and sophisticated functionalities of these devices, spotlighting their pivotal role in ensuring that visually impaired students not only read but actively participate in the discourse of knowledge acquisition.

Refreshable braille displays play a dual role in the educational narrative of visually impaired students. Firstly, they serve as conduits for accessing textual content, enabling the exploration of literature, textbooks, and diverse educational materials in a format that aligns with the tactile language of braille. Secondly, and perhaps more profoundly, these devices empower students to actively contribute to the discourse, facilitating note-taking, writing, and engaging in classroom discussions with the same spontaneity and fluency as their sighted peers.

By providing visually impaired students with the means to interact with written information independently and dynamically, these devices emerge not just as tools but as instruments of empowerment, fostering a sense of agency and paving the way for academic success in the rich landscape of education.

Braille notetakers such as the BrailleSense6 and BrailleNote Touch Plus are essential tools for students with visual impairments to access their schoolwork and receive a free and accessible public education. These devices are small and portable, allowing students to take notes in class using either braille or standard (QWERTY) keyboard, or both. They can also be used to read books, write class assignments, find directions, record lectures, and listen to podcasts 1. The notes written on these devices can be transferred to a computer for storage or printed in either braille or print formats. Many note-taking devices have word processors, appointment calendars, calculators or clocks, and can do almost everything a computer can do. Some note-taking devices have a speech program with braille input. Many newer models are Bluetooth accessible which allows them to be used with iPads, iPhones and other Bluetooth devices as well as Wi-Fi access Braille notetakers are useful not only for note taking in class, but also for composing and printing essays, writing notes, sending e-mails, or browsing the Internet These devices can give students who are blind or have low vision support in all academic areas as well as in expanded core curriculum. By providing students with visual impairments access to braille notetakers, we can help ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed in their studies and beyond. Table \ref{tab:table11} gives the specs for currently available braille notetakers.

  Displays}\label{refreshable-braille-displays}

Refreshable braille displays are essential tools for students with visual impairments to access digital content. The number of braille cells in a display is an important factor to consider when selecting a device. Displays with 32-40 cells are generally better than those with 14-20 cells for several reasons. Firstly, they provide more space for displaying text, which can help reduce the need for scrolling and improve reading speed. Secondly, they allow for more complex formatting, such as tables and graphs, which can be important for STEM subjects. Thirdly, they provide more context for the user, which can help improve comprehension and reduce errors. Fourthly, they are more versatile and can be used for a wider range of tasks, such as taking notes, writing essays, and browsing the internet. Finally, they are more future-proof, as they are more likely to be compatible with new technologies and software updates. While 14-20 cell displays may be more affordable, investing in a 32-40 cell display can provide significant benefits for students with visual impairments in the long run.

	Displays}\label{few-cell-refreshable-braille-displays}
There are some situations where 14-20 cell displays may be more appropriate. For example, if the student only needs to read short messages or simple documents, a smaller display may be sufficient. Additionally, smaller displays are more portable and can be easier to carry around. They may also be more affordable, which can be important for students on a tight budget. Finally, smaller displays may be more appropriate for younger students who are just learning braille and may not need as much space for displaying text. While 14-20 cell displays may not be as versatile as larger displays, they can still provide significant benefits for students with visual impairments in certain situations. Table \ref{tab:table12} lists current available display options.

\hypertarget{learning-tools}{}\section{Braille Education Devices}\label{learning-tools}
In many cases, students do not learn braille as efficiently as their sighted peers learn print. One potential explanation is that there is limited time that a student has access to a teacher trained in braille. One solution is to provide devices that can be used to reinforce or train a student in braille skills without the need for a braille-fluent adult present. This is analogous to the Lexia, Prodigy, or other academic learning systems that allow for self-paced learning.  In the last 5 years, a number of teaching tools have been developed, primarily by groups in India and South Korea to address these needs.

The pioneering companies Thinkerbell Labs in India and OHFA Tech in South Korea, have independently suggested that the low braille literacy rates world wide can be mitigated by providing braille instruction using this type of approach\footnote{\href{https://www.thinkerbelllabs.com/static/decks/tl_deck.pdf}{PDF Slide Deck}}. Both groups have also demonstrated that the use of their products reduces the time to learn braille by upwards of 50\%\footnote{\href{https://www.taptilo.com/}{Taptilo}}. Their reasoning is that the current, more traditional system of braille instruction requires:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hand-holding and constant supervision of a special educator
	\item Primitive teaching methods resulting in slow learning
	\item Non-interactive content keeps the students uninterested and demotivated
\end{itemize}
Table \ref{tab:table15} lists current available options for braille instructional devices.

\hypertarget{embossers}{}\section{Braille Embossers}\label{embossers}
Having access to a high-quality braille embosser is essential for students with visual impairments to receive a free and appropriate public education. Braille embossers are printers that produce braille text and tactile graphics on paper. They are used to create braille copies of textbooks, worksheets, and other educational materials. High-quality embossers produce sharp, clear braille that is easy to read and tactile graphics that are easy to interpret. This is important because it allows students with visual impairments to access the same educational materials as their sighted peers. Braille embossers also allow students to create their own braille notes and written work, which can help improve their literacy skills and independence. By providing students with visual impairments access to high-quality braille embossers, we can help ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed in their studies and beyond.

There are some historical challenges that have befallen blind students that rely on tactile graphics and braille.
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
	\item "Historically, by the time students with visual impairments enter school, they have not received enough instruction in the development and use of their tactile skills or had enough opportunities to touch and explore their world."\footnote{\href{https://www.tsbvi.edu/tx-senseabilities/issues/fall-winter-2016/the-development-of-tactile-skills}{Adkins, A., Sewell, D., \& Cleveland, J. (2016). The Development of Tactile Skills. TX \textit{SenseAbilities, Fall/Winter}.}}
	\item Tactile Graphicacy requires the ability to access, comprehend, and produce tactile graphics or raised line drawings. This requires:\begin{itemize}
		      \item Fine motor sensitivity and dexterity
		      \item Efficient use of carefully constructed knowledge
		      \item Variety of tactile-cognitive strategies
	      \end{itemize}
	\item Students have to develop a perception that there are different kinds of symbolic information on a page with different kinds of meaning
	\item Students have to develop an ability to discriminate between different tactile surfaces and to draw meaning from them
	\item These are \textbf{not} inherant or natural for braille readers as they require:
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item Explicit attention
		      \item Education
		      \item Careful, systematic building of tactile exploratory and interpretive skills
	      \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

There are a number of benefits to having access to accessible tactile graphics in the classroom. These include:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
	\item Provides a focus for attention and perception
	\item Builds pathways to retain and memorize information
	\item Natural destination for conversation and social interaction
	\item Pictures invite and motivate a learner's curiosity and engagement
\end{itemize}

In conclusion, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEIA) mandates that students with disabilities, including those with visual impairments, must be given access to assistive technology to ensure they can participate fully in the curriculum\footnote{\href{https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statuteregulations/}{20 U.S.C. ยง 1400, et.}}. Screen magnification is one such assistive technology that can help students with visual impairments access their free public education. The overarching goal of this document is to shed light on the essential role that technology plays in not only accommodating these students but empowering them to thrive in educational environments. By providing students with visual impairments access to the technology they need, we can help ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed in their studies and beyond.

Assistive technology is a critical component of ensuring that students with visual impairments receive a free and appropriate public education. The technology needs of these students must be addressed within the framework of IDEIA, which mandates that students with disabilities must be given access to assistive technology to ensure they can participate fully in the curriculum. Screen magnification is one such assistive technology that can help students with visual impairments access their free public education. By providing students with visual impairments access to the technology they need, we can help ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed in their studies and beyond.

The use of assistive technology is essential for students with visual impairments to access the same educational materials as their sighted peers. Assistive technology can help students with visual impairments access text information across all curricular areas and participate fully in instruction that is often rich with visual content. The use of assistive technology also helps prepare students for independent living, vocational pursuits, or higher education following graduation from high school. By providing students with visual impairments access to the technology they need, we can help ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed in their studies and beyond.

In conclusion, the use of assistive technology is critical for students with visual impairments to receive a free and appropriate public education. The technology needs of these students must be addressed within the framework of IDEIA\footnote{\href{https://sites.ed.gov/idea/statuteregulations/}{ibid}}, which mandates that students with disabilities must be given access to assistive technology to ensure they can participate fully in the curriculum. Screen magnification is one such assistive technology that can help students with visual impairments access their free public education. By providing students with visual impairments access to the technology they need, we can help ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed in their studies and beyond.
