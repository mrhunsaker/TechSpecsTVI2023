\section{Technology as the Cornerstone of Educational Equity}
\label{sec:conclusion-technology-equity}

This document has demonstrated that technology is not merely an accommodation for students with visual impairments—it is the cornerstone of educational equity. Achieving true equity requires more than compliance with legal mandates; it demands a proactive, evidence-based approach to selecting, implementing, and supporting technology that enables visually impaired students to access, participate in, and excel within the educational environment. \cite{IntroductionChapter1}

\section{Key Findings and Imperatives}
\label{sec:conclusion-key-findings}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Hardware and Performance:} The responsiveness of assistive technologies such as screen readers is fundamentally dependent on robust hardware. Underpowered devices create unacceptable barriers to learning, while high-performance systems empower students to engage with digital content on equal footing with their sighted peers.\footnote{See Chapter 1: Impact of Hardware Limitations on Screen Reader Response Latency.}
    \item \emph{Accessible Devices and Materials:} The integration of tablets, braille notetakers, refreshable braille displays, video magnifiers, and high-quality embossers expands access to literacy, STEM, and the broader curriculum. Tactile graphics and 3D printed models transform abstract concepts into tangible learning experiences.\footnote{See Chapters 2–5.}
    Tools such as text-to-speech engines, DAISY readers, accessible GPS, and daily living technologies foster not only academic achievement but also independence, self-advocacy, and community participation. \cite{Chapters6to8}
    \item \emph{Assessment and Individualization:} There is no one-size-fits-all solution. Individualized assessment frameworks, such as the SETT model, and ongoing collaboration among students, families, and educators are essential to matching technology to each learner’s unique needs.\footnote{See Appendix 3.}
    Effective technology use is sustained by high-quality training, troubleshooting resources, and a commitment to continuous improvement. The appendices provide practical guidance for educators and families to ensure ongoing success. \cite{Appendices1to4}
    Attention to accessible fonts, formatting, and instructional materials ensures that all students—regardless of their degree of vision—can engage with content in a way that maximizes comprehension and comfort. \cite{Appendix5}
\end{itemize}

\section{A Call to Action}
\label{sec:conclusion-call-to-action}

Educational equity for students with visual impairments is not achieved by chance, but by design. It is the result of intentional decisions to prioritize accessibility, invest in appropriate technology, and foster a culture of inclusion and high expectations. As technology continues to evolve, so too must our commitment to leveraging it as a force for justice and opportunity.

By embracing technology as a driver of equity, we empower visually impaired students to pursue academic excellence, independence, and full participation in school and society. The tools, strategies, and frameworks presented in this document are not merely recommendations—they are a roadmap for transforming educational outcomes and realizing the promise of equity for all learners.

\noindent\textit{Let us move forward with resolve, ensuring that every student—regardless of vision—has the technology, support, and opportunity to thrive.}
