\section{Tablet Considerations}\label{ch2:sec:tablet-considerations}

When selecting a \gls{tablet} for a student with a \gls{visualimpairment}, several factors must be considered beyond the standard technical specifications.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Operating System\index{operating system} (OS):} The choice between Android\index{operating system!Android}, iPadOS, Windows\index{operating system!Windows}, and ChromeOS\index{operating system!ChromeOS} often comes down to the built-in accessibility features and the availability of specific apps. iPadOS is often lauded for its robust\index{accessibility!principles} \index{VoiceOver} screen reader\index{screen reader} \supercite{AppleVoiceOver}, while Android's open nature allows for more customization \supercite{AndroidAccessibility, GoogleTalkBack}.
	\item \textbf{Screen Size and Quality:} A larger, high-resolution screen is generally better for students with low vision. Screen quality, including brightness and color accuracy, can also impact readability.\supercite{AFBiOS, AAOTechnologyTools}
	\item \textbf{App Ecosystem:} The availability of educational and assistive apps is a critical factor. The Apple\index{tablet!Apple} App Store and Google\index{tablet!Google} Play Store have vast libraries, but the quality and accessibility\index{accessibility} of apps can vary \supercite{AAOApps}.
	\item \textbf{Physical Characteristics:} The weight and durability of the tablet\index{tablet} are important, especially for younger students. A protective case is almost always a necessity.\supercite{Day2021}
	\item \textbf{AI Integration:} Modern tablets now offer enhanced AI-powered accessibility features, including improved object recognition and natural language processing.\supercite{HIMSReleaseNotes, Android16Release}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion-tablets}
The landscape of assistive technology for visually impaired students continues to evolve rapidly, with new applications and enhanced features being released regularly. When selecting tablets and applications for educational use, it is essential to consider the specific needs of each student, the available budget, and the compatibility with existing assistive technologies. Regular updates to both hardware and software ensure that students have access to the most current and effective tools for their educational success.

The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in accessibility applications has significantly improved the user experience for visually impaired students. From enhanced object recognition to more accurate optical character recognition, these technological advances continue to break down barriers and provide greater independence in educational settings \supercite{Bigham2014}.
