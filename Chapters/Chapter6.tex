\chapter{Amplifying Vision: The Vital Role of Video Magnification Products in Fostering Literacy and Success for Visually Impaired Students}\label{low-vision}

In the realm of visual impairment, the quest for literacy and academic success is a journey characterized by innovation and adaptability. For visually impaired students, the challenge of accessing printed materials, charts, and visual content is met with a powerful solution—video magnification products. The indispensable role that video magnification plays in providing enhanced visual access, breaking down barriers to literacy, and empowering students to navigate the educational landscape with confidence cannot be overstated.

The significance of video magnification products lies in their ability to transform the visual experience for students with visual impairments. As we navigate this chapter, we will unravel the sophisticated functionalities of these devices, showcasing how they go beyond traditional magnification methods to provide an immersive and dynamic visual experience. Whether exploring the pages of a textbook, deciphering intricate diagrams, or engaging with digital content, video magnification stands as a technological ally, ensuring that every student can access and interpret visual information with ease.

In the pursuit of literacy, the role of video magnification becomes increasingly pivotal, particularly in subjects where visual content is integral to comprehension. This chapter will delve into how these products facilitate not only enhanced readability but also active participation in classroom discussions, visual learning activities, and the overall educational experience. By providing visually impaired students with a clear and magnified view of the visual world, video magnification products serve as gateways to knowledge, fostering a sense of inclusion and leveling the playing field in academic settings.

It is evident that these tools are not mere aids; they are essential components in the arsenal of resources necessary for the success of visually impaired students. Video magnification imperatively contributes to shaping a learning environment where visual content is accessible to all, ensuring that literacy and success are attainable goals for every student, regardless of their visual abilities.

\section{Video Magnification Devices}\label{video-magnification-devices}

When purchasing electronic portable magnifiers for students with visual impairments, it is important to consider the following factors to ensure that they can access a free and appropriate public education\footnote{\emph{cf}., \href{http://www.perkins.org/resource/choosing-appropriate-video-magnifier/}{Perkins School for the Blind. (n.d.). Choosing an appropriate video magnifier. Retrieved December 19, 2023}}:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{Magnification power}: The magnification power of the magnifier should be appropriate for the student’s needs. Some magnifiers have a fixed magnification, while others have adjustable magnification.
 \item \emph{Portability}: Portable magnifiers are ideal for students who need to move around the classroom or school. They should be lightweight and easy to carry. Battery life is an important consideration for portable magnifiers. The battery should last long enough to get through a school day without needing to be recharged.
 \item \emph{Ease of use}: The magnifier should be easy to use and adjust. It should have large buttons and controls that are easy to locate and operate. Compatibility with other assistive technology devices, such as screen readers and braille displays, is also important.
 \item \emph{Cost}: The cost of the magnifier should be reasonable and within the school’s budget.
\end{itemize}
These considerations will help ensure that students with visual impairments have access to the tools they need to succeed in school. Table \ref{tab:table21} lists current available video magnification devices for students with visual impairments.
