\chapter{Screen Reader Interaction with Windows Environment and User Data Processing}
\label{chap:screenreader-windows}

This report provides a comprehensive description of how **JAWS**, **NVDA**, **Windows Narrator**, and **Dolphin Supernova** interact with the Windows environment, process user data, and differ in their basic navigation commands and unique features.

\section{Interaction with Windows Environment: Utilizing Accessibility APIs}
\label{sec:interaction-apis}

Screen readers act as intermediaries between the user and the operating system, translating visual information into audible or tactile formats. They achieve this by leveraging Windows' built-in accessibility Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The primary APIs used are **Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA)** and **UI Automation (UIA)**, with **IAccessible2** playing a crucial role, especially for web content.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA):} Introduced with Windows 95, MSAA is a Component Object Model (COM)-based API that allows applications to expose basic UI element information (name, role, state, location) in a hierarchical tree structure. While foundational, MSAA has limitations, particularly in handling complex UI elements, rich text, and modern web content.\footnote{Microsoft Active Accessibility. Wikipedia. \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Active_Accessibility}}
    \item \emph{UI Automation (UIA):} UIA is Microsoft's newer and more robust accessibility framework, designed to overcome MSAA's limitations. It offers a richer object model, a broader set of properties, and "control patterns" that allow for more granular interaction and information retrieval from UI elements.\footnote{UI Automation Overview. Microsoft Learn. \url{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/ui-automation/ui-automation-overview}}
    \item \emph{IAccessible2:} An open-source API based on MSAA, IAccessible2 was developed to address critical accessibility gaps in MSAA, particularly for rich document applications and web browsers. It complements MSAA by providing enhanced semantics and support for complex web technologies (like ARIA).\footnote{Jantrid, A. (2019). The Ins and Outs of IAccessible2. \url{https://jantrid.net/articles/the-ins-and-outs-of-iaccessible2/}}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{How Each Screen Reader Utilizes APIs:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{JAWS (Job Access With Speech):} Utilizes both **UI Automation (UIA)** and **IAccessible2**. For web content, JAWS, like NVDA, continues to heavily rely on IAccessible2 due to UIA's historical and ongoing insufficiencies in fully representing web semantics.\footnote{Jantrid, A. (2019). The Ins and Outs of IAccessible2. \url{https://jantrid.net/articles/the-ins-and-outs-of-iaccessible2/}}\footnote{JAWS: UI Automation Script API. Freedom Scientific. \url{https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/documentation/uia-script-api/}}
    \item \emph{NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access):} Employs a comprehensive approach, utilizing **Microsoft Active Accessibility (MSAA), IAccessible2, Java Access Bridge, and UI Automation**.\footnote{How NVDA Uses Accessibility APIs. Clym. \url{https://clym.io/blog/how-nvda-uses-accessibility-apis}}\footnote{Assistiv Labs. (n.d.). NVDA's Architecture. \url{https://www.assistivlabs.com/blog/nvdas-architecture}} NVDA's architecture includes specific **API handlers** (e.g., \texttt{IAccessibleHandler}, \texttt{JABHandler}, \texttt{UIAHandler}) that abstract API complexities, allowing the core of NVDA to work with a unified, abstract representation of UI elements called "NVDA Objects."
    \item \emph{Windows Narrator:} As a built-in Windows screen reader, Narrator is deeply integrated with the operating system and primarily relies on the **Microsoft UI Automation framework**.\footnote{Narrator Technical Details. Microsoft Learn. \url{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wnauto/narrator-technical-details}}
    \item \emph{Dolphin Supernova:} While explicit technical documentation detailing its precise API usage is less publicly available, Supernova, as a comprehensive screen reader for Windows, is understood to leverage the standard Windows accessibility APIs, including **UI Automation** and **Microsoft Active Accessibility**.\footnote{SuperNova Magnifier \& Screen Reader. Dolphin Computer Access. \url{https://www.dolphincomputeraccess.com/product/supernova/}} Its ability to announce detailed information about UI elements, formatting, and on-screen changes strongly implies its reliance on these underlying system interfaces. It also likely uses IAccessible2 for robust web accessibility, similar to JAWS and NVDA.
\end{itemize}

\section{Intercepting and Processing User Inputs}
\label{sec:intercepting-inputs}

Screen readers intercept user inputs, primarily keyboard commands and sometimes touch gestures, to navigate the Windows environment and trigger specific actions or information retrieval. They often employ a "modifier key" (e.g., Insert key, Caps Lock) in combination with other keys to differentiate screen reader commands from standard application commands.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{JAWS:} Intercepts keyboard commands extensively, using the \emph{Insert key} (or Caps Lock) as its primary modifier key.\footnote{JAWS Basic Commands. Deque University. \url{https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/jaws-basic-commands/}} Features a \emph{Virtual Cursor} for web Browse and document reading, which allows navigation without moving the actual system focus. When interacting with forms or editable content, it automatically or manually switches to \emph{Forms Mode}, passing keystrokes directly to the application.\footnote{JAWS Keyboard Commands and Gestures. Access Ingenuity. \url{https://accessingen.com/jaws-keyboard-commands-and-gestures/}}
    \item \emph{NVDA:} Processes keyboard commands, often using the \emph{NVDA key} (Insert or Caps Lock by default) as a modifier.\footnote{NVDA User Guide: Keyboard Commands. NV Access. \url{https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html\#KeyboardCommands}} Employs distinct \emph{Browse Mode} and \emph{Focus Mode}. In Browse Mode (default for web pages and documents), NVDA intercepts most keystrokes for navigation. In Focus Mode, keystrokes are passed directly to the application. Supports touch gestures for Windows tablets.\footnote{NVDA User Guide: Keyboard Commands. NV Access. \url{https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html\#KeyboardCommands}}
    \item \emph{Windows Narrator:} Intercepts keyboard commands using the \emph{Narrator key} (Caps Lock or Insert by default).\footnote{Narrator Keyboard Commands. U.S. Department of the Treasury. \url{https://www.fiscal.treasury.gov/files/narrator-keyboard-commands.pdf}} Features a \emph{Scan mode} (Narrator key + Spacebar) for navigating web pages and documents, similar to browse mode in other screen readers. Supports touch gestures for navigation, particularly useful on touch-enabled devices.\footnote{Complete guide to Narrator. Microsoft Support. \url{https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8c2-a1897d781b00}}
    \item \emph{Dolphin Supernova:} Utilizes a range of \emph{hotkeys}, often involving the \emph{Caps Lock key} as a modifier, though it can be customized.\footnote{SuperNova Hotkeys. Dolphin Computer Access. \url{https://www.dolphincomputeraccess.com/product/supernova/hotkeys/}} Features a \emph{Dolphin Cursor} for exploring the screen and includes a \emph{Forms Mode} that automatically activates when navigating to editable fields.\footnote{SuperNova Hotkeys.

\section{Internal Data Processing Pipelines and Rendering Logic}
\label{sec:data-pipelines}

The core of a screen reader's functionality lies in how it interprets raw accessibility data from the Windows environment and transforms it into meaningful output. This involves building an internal representation of the UI and applying rendering logic to determine what information to present and how.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{JAWS:} Interprets accessibility data to construct a logical representation of the screen. Its "JAWS Inspect" tool provides a visual, text-based view of how JAWS interprets digital content, including reading order, hierarchy of headings, labels, roles, and states of controls.\footnote{JAWS Inspect. Freedom Scientific. \url{https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/jaws-inspect/}} Features like "AI Labeler" demonstrate its ability to process visual information (screenshots) using AI to generate accessible names for unlabeled elements.\footnote{AI Labeler. Freedom Scientific. \url{https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/ai-labeler/}} Its "Text Processing" and "Language Processing" groups show a focus on intelligent content analysis.\footnote{What's New in JAWS. Freedom Scientific. \url{https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/whats-new/}}
    \item \emph{NVDA:} Builds an internal object model using "NVDA Objects," which are abstract representations of UI widgets.\footnote{Assistiv Labs. (n.d.). NVDA's Architecture. \url{https://www.assistivlabs.com/blog/nvdas-architecture}} These objects contain properties like name, role, states, value, description, location, and relational properties. Uses "TextInfo objects" to handle text navigation and formatting. Its rendering logic involves processing symbol pronunciation and providing contextual properties.\footnote{NVDA User Guide: Speech. NV Access. \url{https://www.nvaccess.org/files/nvda/documentation/userGuide.html\#Speech}}
    \item \emph{Windows Narrator:} Leverages the UI Automation framework to build its understanding of the UI. Its rendering logic determines whether text should be read as part of a tab-sequence traversal or as part of an overall document representation.\footnote{Narrator Technical Details. Microsoft Learn. \url{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wnauto/narrator-technical-details}} Recent advancements include AI-driven image descriptions\footnote{Get image descriptions from Narrator. Microsoft Support. \url{https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-image-descriptions-from-narrator-c800c765-b772-4017-8e6c-7f5ddf5b721e}}
    \item \emph{Dolphin Supernova:} Employs "True Fonts" technology to ensure text clarity at high magnification levels.\footnote{SuperNova Features. Dolphin Computer Access. \url{https://www.dolphincomputeraccess.com/product/supernova/features/}} Its "Monitor markers" feature suggests an internal mechanism for detecting and announcing dynamic changes on the screen. Improved speech announcements for specific contexts, such as Excel cell coordinates, show a refined rendering logic. "Doc Reader" and "Line View" are dedicated reading modes that reflow and present text in optimized ways.\footnote{SuperNova Features. Dolphin Computer Access. \url{https://www.dolphincomputeraccess.com/product/supernova/features/}}
