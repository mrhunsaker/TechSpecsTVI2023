\chapter{Comparison of the iWing App and Dot Canvas App}

This chapter provides a comprehensive comparison between the \textbf{iWing app} by the American Printing House for the Blind (APH) for the Monarch braille device, and the \textbf{Dot Canvas app} from Dot Incorporation for the Dot Pad and Dot Pad X devices. Both ecosystems enhance tactile and braille access, but differ in capabilities, user experience, and ecosystem integration\supercite{paths_monarch}\supercite{dot_appstore}\supercite{ces_dotcanvas}.
