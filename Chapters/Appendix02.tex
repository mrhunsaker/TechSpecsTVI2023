\section{~~Braille Notetakers}
\label{app2:notebook}
If your Braille notetaker is not responding to user input, there are several modern troubleshooting\index{troubleshooting} steps you can try. The following steps are presented in a logical order for accessibility\index{accessibility}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Power and Charging:} Ensure that the device is properly charged and turned on. Many current devices now support USB-C charging, which provides faster and more reliable power delivery.
	\item \textbf{Soft Reset:} If the device is still not working, try performing a soft reset by holding down the power button for 10-15 seconds, or check if your device has a dedicated reset button.
	\item \textbf{Bluetooth and Compatibility:} For connectivity issues, ensure that Bluetooth is properly paired if using wireless connections, as most modern Braille notetakers now support Bluetooth connectivity for enhanced mobility. Check that your device is compatible with your current screen reader software, as compatibility requirements have evolved significantly with recent updates to NVDA, JAWS\index{screen reader!JAWS}, and other screen readers\index{screen reader}.
	\item \textbf{Device-Specific Steps:}
	      \begin{itemize}
		      \item \textbf{BrailleNote Touch Plus:} If you are using a BrailleNote Touch Plus (now available in 32-cell configurations), you can reset the device through the Android\index{operating system!Android} settings menu, as these devices now run on Android Oreo platform for enhanced functionality~\supercite{BrailleNoteTouchPlus32}. This Android-based system provides access to Google\index{tablet!Google} Play Store apps and enhanced web browsing capabilities.
		      \item \textbf{BrailleSense 6:} For BrailleSense 6 users, the device now supports advanced features including improved wireless connectivity and enhanced battery life. You can update the firmware through the device's built-in update system or by connecting to Wi-Fi and downloading updates directly~\supercite{BrailleSense6}.
	      \end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Diagnostics:} Modern Braille notetakers\index{notetaker!braille notetaker} also feature improved troubleshooting\index{troubleshooting} diagnostics. Many devices now include self-diagnostic tools that can identify hardware\index{hardware} issues, connectivity problems, or software\index{software} conflicts. Access these through the device's utilities menu or settings panel.
\end{itemize}

\section{~~Braille Displays}
\label{app2:display2}
Current refreshable Braille displays\index{braille display} offer enhanced connectivity options and improved troubleshooting\index{troubleshooting} capabilities. The following steps are recommended for troubleshooting:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{USB and Bluetooth:} If your display is not responding to your computer's screen reader\index{screen reader}, start by checking both USB and Bluetooth connections, as most modern displays support dual connectivity modes.
	\item \textbf{USB Cable Quality:} For USB connections, ensure you're using a high-quality USB cable, preferably USB-C where supported, as older micro-USB cables may cause intermittent connection issues. Many displays now feature USB-C ports for more reliable data transfer and power delivery.
	\item \textbf{Driver Installation:} Modern Braille displays\index{braille display} often include automatic driver installation, but manual driver updates may be necessary. Check Windows\index{operating system!Windows} Device Manager or your operating system\index{operating system}'s accessibility\index{accessibility} settings to verify proper driver installation. Recent Windows 11 updates have improved native Braille display support significantly.
	\item \textbf{Text-to-Speech\index{text-to-speech} Feedback:} The latest Braille displays, such as the Brailliant BI 20X, now include built-in text-to-speech\index{text-to-speech} functionality, providing a hybrid experience~\supercite{BrailliantBI20X}. This can help with troubleshooting\index{troubleshooting} by providing audio feedback during setup and configuration.
	\item \textbf{Wireless Range:} For wireless connectivity issues, ensure your display is within range (typically 30 feet) and that no other Bluetooth devices are interfering. Modern displays support Bluetooth 5.0 for improved range and stability.
	\item \textbf{Firmware Updates:} If problems persist, many current displays feature firmware update capabilities through Wi-Fi or USB connections. Regular firmware updates address compatibility issues and improve performance with evolving screen reader\index{screen reader} software.
\end{itemize}
