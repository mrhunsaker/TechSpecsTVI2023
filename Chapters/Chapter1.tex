In the dynamic landscape of education, technology stands as a powerful enabler, breaking down barriers and creating pathways for inclusivity. Nowhere is this more evident than in the realm of assistive technology designed for visually impaired students. Among the myriad tools at their disposal, screen readers and magnification programs emerge as keystones, indispensable in shaping an environment where success is not just attainable but expected.

For visually impaired students, these tools represent a digital gateway to a world of knowledge, interaction, and independent learning. This chapter endeavors to illuminate the significance of screen readers and magnification programs, highlighting their essential roles in fostering student success. As the educational landscape continues to evolve, it is crucial to recognize that the transformative power of technology is not a luxury but a necessity, especially for those whose access to information is mediated by visual impairments.

Screen readers, with their adept ability to convert digital text into synthesized speech, empower visually impaired students to engage with written content. As we delve into the intricacies of these tools, we will uncover their pivotal role in granting students access to textbooks, online resources, and educational materials that are the bedrock of academic achievement. Simultaneously, magnification programs play a crucial role in enhancing visual content, allowing students to explore images, charts, and diagrams with a level of detail that might otherwise be elusive.

Screen magnification is another crucial tool for students with visual impairments, as it enables them to access text and other visual content in the classroom.  By magnifying the text and images on the screen, students can read and view the content more easily, which can help them keep up with their peers and achieve academic success. In this chapter, we will explore the importance of screen magnification for students with visual impairments and how it can help them access their free public education.

Through the lens of accessibility, this exploration seeks to underscore the imperative nature of these technologies, not as mere tools but as companions on the road to success for visually impaired students navigating the educational landscape.

As a student with visual impairments, accessing a free and appropriate public education can be challenging. However, with the help of special software, students can overcome these challenges and achieve academic success. Assistive Technology has improved the lives of students and adults living with visual impairments by providing access, connectedness, and engagement. The use of assistive technology can facilitate a learning environment where students are able to better access their educational program through low or high technology accommodations.

Incorporating special software can help students with visual impairments to access the same educational resources as their peers. It can also help them to learn at their own pace and in their own way. For instance, screen readers and magnification options built into mainstream tablets and smartphones can help students with visual impairments to read and write emails, texts, and documents.

In addition, technology can help students with visual impairments to become active learners. Traditional lectures may not be the optimal learning style for visually impaired students. However, hands-on engagement through technology can help them to better understand and complete assignments and tests2.

By using special software, students with visual impairments can have equal access to educational opportunities and can be better prepared for the real world. It can also help them to acquire the skills required for independent living and getting higher education.

Table \ref{tab:table1} is a list of software used to access material as well as necessary academic software used by students with visual impairments\footnote{\raggedright We focus on Windows-based laptops due to the ubiquity of Windows-based software used in schools. MacOS-based laptops are more than adequate to run software along with the built in VoiceOver screenreader  To date there are no additional screenreaders for MacOS, however one is currently in development called \href{http://youtu.be/qTkS-zNzF88?si=3XTXtbyOWD9kvwlk}{VOSH} \url{http://youtu.be/qTkS-zNzF88?si=3XTXtbyOWD9kvwlk}. There are multiple Linux distributions that are actively working to improve ORCA screenreader accessibility within the GNOME desktop environment. There are also a number of independently developed screenreaders for Linux architectures as well as Chromebooks}\fnsep\footnote{\raggedright This includes the TVI teaching how to use the software skills, but primarily refers to programs visually impaired students need to access the curriculum}. This information will be used to determine necessary laptop specifications for students using these software to access their schoolwork at the same time as their sighted peers.

\pagebreak \hypertarget{ram-requirements}{}\section{RAM Requirements}\label{ram-requirements}
Having a computer with sufficient RAM and processor speed is crucial for the effective functioning of a screen reader, which serves as a vital assistive technology for individuals with visual impairments. A screen reader relies heavily on processing power and memory to rapidly convert textual information into synthesized speech or refreshable braille displays, allowing users to access and navigate digital content. A computer with inadequate RAM or a slow processor may struggle to process and relay information in real-time, resulting in delayed responses, sluggish navigation, and an overall compromised user experience. Insufficient hardware specifications can significantly hinder the screen reader's ability to provide timely and accurate information, rendering it an inadequate accommodation for individuals with visual impairments. Therefore, ensuring that the computer meets or exceeds the recommended RAM and processor speed is essential to guarantee an optimal and seamless user experience, empowering individuals with visual impairments to access and engage with digital content effectively.

\pagebreak 	\hypertarget{current-laptop-performance-measured}{}\section{Current Laptop Performance}\label{current-laptop-performance-measured}
Having a computer with sufficient RAM and an up-to-date processor is crucial for running a screenreader and screen magnifier smoothly as a student with visual impairments in order to receive a free and appropriate public education. Screenreaders and screen magnifiers are software applications that require a significant amount of processing power and memory to function properly. Insufficient RAM can cause the screenreader or screen magnifier to load slowly, which can lead to delays in the user’s workflow. An up-to-date processor is also important because it can help ensure that the software runs smoothly and efficiently. By having a computer with sufficient RAM and an up-to-date processor, students with visual impairments can access the same educational materials as their sighted peers and participate fully in the curriculum. This can help improve their academic performance and ensure that they have the tools they need to succeed in their studies and beyond.

In addition to having sufficient RAM and an up-to-date processor, it is also important to ensure that the computer is running the latest version of the screenreader and screen magnifier software. Software updates often include bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features that can help improve the user experience. By keeping the software up-to-date, students with visual impairments can ensure that they are getting the most out of their assistive technology. It is also important to ensure that the computer is free of malware and other malicious software that can slow down the system and interfere with the operation of the screenreader and screen magnifier. By taking these steps, students with visual impairments can ensure that their computer is running optimally and that they have the tools they need to succeed in their studies and beyond.

\pagebreak \hypertarget{screenreader-loading}{}\section{Screenreader Loading}\label{screenreader-loading}
The latency of a screenreader is the time it takes for the software to load and start functioning. It is important to measure the latency of a screenreader to determine if the laptop has sufficient RAM to run the software properly. Insufficient RAM can cause the screenreader to load slowly, which can lead to delays in the user’s workflow. Measuring the latency of a screenreader can help identify if the laptop has enough RAM to run the software smoothly. This can help users avoid frustration and improve their productivity. In addition to identifying insufficient RAM, measuring the latency of a screenreader can also help users identify if there are other issues with their laptop that may be causing the software to run slowly. For example, if the latency is still high even after upgrading the RAM, it could be an indication of a slow hard drive or outdated drivers. By measuring the latency of a screenreader, users can ensure that their laptop is running optimally and that they are getting the most out of their software. It is recommended to measure the latency of a screenreader periodically to ensure that the laptop is running smoothly and to identify any issues that may arise.

Figure \ref{fig:figure 1} shows a boxplot of the latency to load JAWS measured across the various student and professional computers I had access to. The student laptop generally took \textgreater2 minutes for JAWS to load, a higher spec student laptop took about 1 minute, and the professional laptops took under a minute\footnote{\raggedright \href{http://github.com/mrhunsaker/MiscResources/raw/main/ComputerRBDisplaySpecsTVIFig1.zip}{Zipped Interactive HTML version of Figure \ref{fig:figure 1}} \hfill\break\url{http://github.com/mrhunsaker/MiscResources/raw/main/ComputerRBDisplaySpecsTVIFig1.zip}}.

\hypertarget{screenreader-response}{}\section{Screenreader Responsiveness}\label{screenreader-response}
Measuring the latency of a screenreader to respond to key presses is important to determine if the laptop has sufficient RAM to run the software properly. If the laptop has insufficient RAM, the screenreader may take longer to respond to key presses, which can lead to delays in the user’s workflow. Measuring the latency of a screenreader can help identify if the laptop has enough RAM to run the software smoothly. This can help users avoid frustration and improve their productivity. Additionally, measuring the latency of a screenreader can help users identify if there are other issues with their laptop that may be causing the software to run slowly. By measuring the latency of a screenreader, users can ensure that their laptop is running optimally and that they are getting the most out of their software.

\pagebreak \hypertarget{notes-on-future-proofing-laptops}{}\section{Laptop Cost Factors}\label{notes-on-future-proofing-laptops}
Students with visual impairments require laptops that are compatible with assistive technology to receive a free and accessible public education. When selecting a laptop, there are several cost factors that must be taken into account. Firstly, the laptop should have sufficient RAM to run the assistive technology software smoothly. Secondly, the laptop should have a high-quality screen that is large enough to display text and images clearly. Thirdly, the laptop should have a long battery life to ensure that students can use it for extended periods of time without needing to recharge. Fourthly, the laptop should have a durable build quality to withstand daily wear and tear. Finally, the laptop should be lightweight and portable to enable students to carry it around easily. These factors can help ensure that students with visual impairments have access to the technology they need to succeed in their studies.

\hypertarget{future-proofing}{}\subsection{Laptop Durability}\label{future-proofing}

I asked ChatGPT why we should consider future usage needs of a laptop into my purchasing plans and here is its response (emphasis mine):

\begin{leftbar} \begin{quote}
		Buying laptops with high-end RAM and processor specifications can be beneficial for several reasons, especially in terms of longevity and performance. Here are some key considerations:

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

			\item
			      Future-Proofing:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      Investing in higher-end components can help future-proof your laptop to some extent. As software and applications become more demanding over time, a laptop with better specifications is likely to remain relevant and capable of handling new software updates and requirements.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{1}

			\item
			      Multitasking and Performance:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      Higher RAM allows for better multitasking capabilities. If you use resource-intensive applications or run multiple programs simultaneously, having ample RAM prevents slowdowns and ensures smooth performance.
			\item
			      A powerful processor can handle complex computations and tasks more efficiently, contributing to faster overall system performance.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{2}

			\item
			      Graphics Processing:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      For tasks such as video editing, gaming, or other graphics-intensive applications, a high-end GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) is crucial. This is separate from RAM and the main processor but is equally important for certain tasks.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{3}

			\item
			      Long-Term Usability:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      Technology advances quickly, and what is considered high-end today might become standard or entry-level in a few years. However, starting with a high-end laptop gives you a more extended period before your system becomes outdated.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{4}

			\item
			      Smooth Upgrades:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      Some laptops allow users to upgrade certain components like RAM and storage. Starting with higher-end specifications provides more headroom for future upgrades, allowing you to extend the useful life of your laptop.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{5}

			\item
			      Resource-Intensive Applications:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      If you use applications that require a lot of processing power, like video editing software, 3D modeling tools, or virtualization software, a high-end laptop can handle these tasks more efficiently, providing a better user experience.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{6}

			\item
			      Responsiveness and Speed:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      A faster processor and more RAM contribute to a more responsive system. Applications load quicker, and the overall user experience is smoother, which can significantly impact productivity.
		\end{itemize}

		\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=*]
			\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
			\setcounter{enumi}{7}

			\item
			      Enhanced Resale Value:
		\end{enumerate}

		\begin{itemize}

			\item
			      High-end laptops generally retain their value better than lower-end models. If you decide to sell or upgrade your laptop in the future, having top-tier specifications can make it more attractive to potential buyers.
		\end{itemize}

		It's important to note that the specific requirements depend on your usage patterns and needs. Not everyone needs the highest specifications, and sometimes a mid-range laptop can be more than sufficient for everyday tasks. However, \textbf{for users with demanding workloads or those who want a longer usable life from their device, opting for higher-end specifications can be a wise investment}.
	\end{quote}\end{leftbar}

\pagebreak	\hypertarget{optimizing-cost-with-performance}{}\subsection{Laptop Cost Optimization}\label{optimizing-cost-with-performance}

There is an economic theory based on a Terry Pratchett novel that explains this phenomenon better than we can. It is called the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boots_theory}{Boots Theory}\footnote{\raggedright Full Text (emphasis mine):
	\begin{leftbar}
		\begin{quote}The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

			Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

			But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. \textbf{A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that’d still be keeping his feet dry in ten years’ time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.}

			Basically, \textbf{we are destined to be stuck in a cycle of perpetually spending more money for inferior products and will, in the end, spend more money than if we just paid for better product in the first place.} -- \textit{Men At Arms}, page 38
		\end{quote}
	\end{leftbar} 
 }

\hfill \break Table \ref{tab:table6} illustrates this theory in terms of student laptop computers (Assuming student has a laptop using a screenreader through 3rd-12th grade). Table \ref{tab:table6} also illustrates why we choose to err on the side of spending \$2000-3000 on a laptop computer that will last 3-5 years over spending \$1500-2000 on a laptop that will reach end-of-life within 1-2 years before becoming obsolete. By the end of 5 years we will have spent more on Low End and Mid Range Laptops than we would have otherwise spent had we purchased a High End Laptop. Importantly; however, we also would have been using laptops that always performed more poorly than a High End laptop would.
