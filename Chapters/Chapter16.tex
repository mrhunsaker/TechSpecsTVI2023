\chapter{Accessibility Auditing for Internet-Based Materials: A Comprehensive Guide}
\label{chap:accessibility-auditing}

\section{~~Introduction}
\label{sec:intro-auditing}
In the digital age, ensuring that internet-based materials are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is not just a matter of ethical responsibility but also a legal and commercial imperative. An accessibility audit\index{accessibility!accessibility testing} is a systematic evaluation of a website, application, or digital document against established accessibility\index{accessibility} standards \supercite{DisabilityRightsAuditing}. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, methodologies, and tools required to conduct a thorough accessibility audit, from initial planning to remediation\index{accessibility!remediation strategies} and continuous monitoring\index{accessibility!Quality Assurance} \supercite{Lazar2015}.

\section{~~Fundamental Principles and Standards}
\label{sec:principles-standards}
A successful accessibility audit is grounded in a deep understanding of core accessibility principles\index{accessibility!accessibility principles} and the legal standards that enforce them.

\subsection{Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)}
\label{subsec:wcag}
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines\index{WCAG} (WCAG), developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), are the globally recognized standard for web accessibility. WCAG is organized around four core principles, often remembered by the acronym POUR.
\supercite{WCAG21, WCAG2018}

\subsubsection{Perceivable}
\label{ssubsec:perceivable}
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive. This means providing text alternatives for non-text content, captions for multimedia, and ensuring content is adaptable and distinguishable.
\supercite{WCAGNonText2018}

\subsubsection{Operable}
\label{ssubsec:operable}
User interface components and \gls{navigation} must be operable. This includes making all functionality available from a keyboard, giving users enough time to read and use content, and avoiding content that is known to cause seizures.
\supercite{WebAIMKeyboardA11y}

\subsubsection{Understandable}
\label{ssubsec:understandable}
Information and the operation of the user interface must be understandable. This involves making text readable and understandable, making web pages appear and operate in predictable ways, and helping users avoid and correct mistakes.
\supercite{Redish2012}

\subsubsection{Robust}
\label{ssubsec:robust}
Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies\index{assistive technology}. This means maximizing compatibility with current and future user agents.
\supercite{WCAGPrincipleRobust}

\subsection{Section 508 and Legal Frameworks}
\label{subsec:section508-legal}
In the United States, Section 508\index{accessibility!legal accessibility} of the Rehabilitation Act requires federal agencies to make their electronic and information technology\index{technology} accessible to people with disabilities. Many other countries have similar legal frameworks, such as the European Accessibility\index{accessibility} Act, which often reference WCAG as the standard for compliance.
\supercite{Section5082018, Jaeger2006}

\section{~~Comprehensive Audit Methodology}
\label{sec:audit-methodology}
A thorough accessibility audit\index{accessibility!accessibility testing} combines automated tools, manual testing\index{accessibility!Manual Testing}, and user feedback to identify and address accessibility barriers.
\supercite{Henry2007}

\subsection{Planning Phase}
\label{subsec:planning-phase}
The planning phase involves defining the scope of the audit, identifying the target WCAG\index{WCAG} conformance level (A, AA, or AAA), selecting representative pages or user flows to test, and assembling the right team and tools.

\subsection{Automated Testing Phase}
\label{subsec:automated-testing-phase}
Automated tools can quickly scan a website or application to detect a significant percentage of common accessibility issues, such as missing alt text, insufficient color contrast\index{accessibility!insufficient color contrast}, and incorrect heading structures. However, they cannot identify all issues.

\subsection{Manual Testing Phase}
\label{subsec:manual-testing-phase}
Manual testing is essential for evaluating aspects that automated tools cannot, such as keyboard navigation, screen reader\index{screen reader} compatibility, and the logical flow of content. This phase requires a deep understanding of accessibility principles\index{accessibility!accessibility principles} and how users with disabilities interact with digital content.

\subsection{User Testing Phase}
\label{subsec:user-testing-phase}
Involving users with disabilities in the testing process provides invaluable insights into the real-world usability of a product. User testing\index{accessibility!User Testing} can uncover issues that may not be apparent through automated or manual testing\index{accessibility!Manual Testing} alone.
\supercite{Petrie2006}
