\chapter{Beyond Boundaries: Text-to-Speech and DAISY as Catalysts for Literacy and Success in Visual Impairment Education}\label{audio}

The National Instructional Materials Accessibility Standard (NIMAS) and Digital Accessible Information System (DAISY) are two important tools for the education of students with visual impairments. NIMAS is a technical standard used by publishers to prepare electronic files that are used to convert instructional materials into accessible formats. The purpose of NIMAS is to help increase the availability and timely delivery of instructional materials in accessible formats for qualifying students in elementary and secondary schools, with the National Instructional Materials Access Center (NIMAC) serving as a federally funded, online file repository of more than 83,000 K-12 NIMAS files\footnote{\href{https://www.nimac.us/}{NIMAC. (2025). National Instructional Materials Access Center. Retrieved July 4, 2025}}. DAISY is a digital format for audio books that is designed to be more accessible to people with visual impairments, with files that can be used to produce formats like braille, EPUB, DAISY, and large print\footnote{\href{https://daisy.org/}{DAISY Consortium. (2024). What is DAISY? Retrieved July 4, 2025}}.

Under IDEA, students must be receiving special education services under IDEA and meet the qualification criteria of the National Library Service for the Blind and Print Disabled (NLS) statute to be eligible for NIMAS-derived materials through the NIMAC\footnote{\href{https://portal.ct.gov/SDE/Publications/Assistive-Technology-Guidelines-Section-1-For-Ages-3-22/Accessible-Educational-Materials}{Connecticut State Department of Education. (2025). Accessible Educational Materials. Retrieved July 4, 2025}}.

NIMAS and DAISY are important because they help make educational materials more accessible to students with visual impairments. By providing instructional materials in accessible formats, students with visual impairments can participate more fully in the general education curriculum. This can help improve their academic performance and increase their chances of success in school.

Finally, NIMAS and DAISY can help students with visual impairments become more independent. By providing instructional materials in accessible formats, students can read books, take notes, and communicate with others more easily. This can help them lead more fulfilling lives and become more active members of their communities.

In the evolving landscape of education, the pursuit of literacy is a journey marked by innovation and inclusivity. For visually impaired students, the traditional pathways to literacy take on a distinctive form, guided by the transformative power of audiobook and DAISY readers. This chapter explores the indispensable role that these tools play in breaking down barriers to literacy, ensuring access to knowledge, and propelling visually impaired students towards academic success.

\section{DAISY Readers}\label{text-to-speech-music-podcast}

Assistive technology is a crucial tool for students with visual impairments or blindness to receive a free and appropriate public education. DAISY (Digital Accessible Information System) is a technical standard for digital audiobooks, periodicals, and computerized text that is designed to be a complete audio substitute for print material and is specifically designed for use by people with print disabilities, including blindness, impaired vision, and dyslexia\footnote{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Accessible_Information_System}{Wikipedia. (2024). Digital Accessible Information System. Retrieved July 4, 2025}}.

Based on the MP3 and XML formats, the DAISY format has advanced features in addition to those of a traditional audiobook. Users can search, place bookmarks, precisely navigate line by line, and regulate the speaking speed without distortion\footnote{Ibid.}. DAISY also provides aurally accessible tables, references and additional information. As a result, DAISY allows visually impaired listeners to navigate something as complex as an encyclopedia or textbook, otherwise impossible using conventional audio recordings\footnote{\href{https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/33638}{Encyclopedia MDPI. (2022). DAISY Digital Talking Book. Retrieved July 4, 2025}}.

DAISY books provide full accessibility for the reader and allow the reader to play the book on a variety of hardware and software players depending on the DAISY file type (e.g., CD players, mobile phones, computers, iPods \& iPads, tablets, etc.)\footnote{\href{https://www.cde.ca.gov/re/pn/sm/dtbdefinitions.asp}{California Department of Education. (2025). Digital Talking Books. Retrieved July 4, 2025}}.

\section{Text-to-Speech}\label{text-to-speech}

The use of assistive technology, including Text-to-Speech, is required for all students with disabilities that show a need under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), with eligibility criteria including those with visual impairments, perceptual disabilities, or those otherwise unable through physical disability to hold or manipulate a book or to focus or move the eyes to the extent that would be normally acceptable for reading\footnote{\href{https://ncademi.org/resources/publications/aem-guide/}{National Center on Accessible Digital Educational Materials. (2024). Addressing Accessible Educational Materials in the 2024 Assistive Technology Guidance. Retrieved July 4, 2025}}.

With the push of a single button, text to speech devices photograph your reading material and within seconds, begin reading it aloud. These easy-to-use devices are ideal for blind users of all ages and abilities. Some devices offer the option of smart reading features that enable you to simply ask for the text that interests you and some even offer facial and product recognition\footnote{\href{https://www.visionaid.co.uk/text-to-speech}{VisionAid.
