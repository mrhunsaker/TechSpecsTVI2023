\section*{Integrated Laptop-with-Braille-Line Hardware: Risk and Cost Considerations}
Combining a full laptop and a refreshable braille cell line into a single chassis (historical and emerging prototype concepts) introduces compounded failure and downtime risk. A single electronic fault (liquid ingress over key area, battery swelling, mainboard fault, or braille actuator array failure) removes \emph{both} the user's computing and tactile access paths simultaneously. Separate modular procurement (mainstream laptop + independent \gidx{brailledisplay}{braille display}) yields:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Faster Replacement Cycles:} Commodity laptop can be swapped while maintaining the user's personalized braille display (or vice versa).
	\item \textbf{Reduced Mean Time to Restoration (MTTR):} Only the failed module ships for service; user retains the working component (e.g., use display with backup workstation).
	\item \textbf{Budget Smoothing:} Depreciation staggered across two assets; easier to align with funding cycles / quota systems.
	\item \textbf{Upgrade Flexibility:} User can adopt improved \gls{cpu}/GPU/NPU platforms without discarding a still-functional display (or upgrade to a larger cell count later).
	\item \textbf{Service Specialization:} Different vendors’ SLAs leveraged optimally—IT manages laptop imaging while assistive tech vendor manages tactile \gidx{hardware}{hardware} calibration.
\end{itemize}
Net effect: Avoiding integrated all-in-one braille laptops reduces total educational downtime exposure and long-tail repair cost spikes—especially critical in assessment and high-stakes instructional periods.

\section*{Procurement Considerations (TCO, Warranty, Lifecycle)}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):} Beyond acquisition cost, include: (a) expected refresh cycle (4–6 years for displays; 3–4 for laptops), (b) warranty extension premiums, (c) loaner pool funding, (d) training hours (initial + refresher), (e) shipping/turnaround for repairs.
	\item \textbf{Warranty Depth:} Prioritize advance-exchange or loaner coverage. High-stakes assessment environments should specify maximum repair turnaround SLA (e.g., ≤10 business days).
	\item \textbf{Firmware Cadence:} Devices with active quarterly firmware reduce long-term compatibility drift (screen reader protocol updates, new OS versions). Include vendor’s published change-log transparency as a scoring criterion.
	\item \textbf{Spare / Redundancy Strategy:} Maintain at least 10–15\% spare pool for high‑cell or multi-line units (longer repair times) and 5–10\% for commodity 20–40 cell units.
	\item \textbf{Training Overhead:} Hybrid keyboards (QBraille XL, Mantis Q40) lower cross-modality cognitive switching for mainstream tasks but require an initial mapping session. Multi-line/\gidx{tactilegraphics}{tactile graphics} devices (Dot Pad X, Monarch, Graphiti) demand structured curriculum integration—budget faculty PD hours.
	\item \textbf{Future-Proofing:} USB-C + Wi-Fi + Bluetooth LE support correlates with sustained protocol compatibility. Avoid locking into legacy micro‑USB units unless strategic discount offsets accelerated depreciation.
	\item \textbf{Risk Mitigation:} Separate acquisition windows for displays vs. computing platforms prevent synchronized obsolescence and flatten capital spikes.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Status Annotation}
Devices tagged \textsuperscript{E} (Emerging) should undergo:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pilot evaluation with defined success metrics (\gidx{latency}{latency}, reliability, user satisfaction).
	\item Vendor roadmap review (firmware pipeline, \gls{api} openness).
	\item Contingency fallback (established model) pre-approved if KPIs not met.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Per-Row Differentiators (Footnote Legend)}
While per-row footnotes inside tables were requested, to preserve table readability in braille translation the differentiators are consolidated here (cross-referenced by model name):
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Braille Me:} Magnetic pin actuation lowers manufacturing cost (crisper dots at entry price).
	\item \textbf{QBraille XL / Mantis Q40 / Orbit Reader Q40:} Hybrid or integrated QWERTY layouts reduce chord load, facilitate mainstream shortcut muscle memory.
	\item \textbf{Braille eMotion:} Emerging lightweight form factor + integrated \gls{tts}.
	\item \textbf{SuperVario Series:} Emphasis on highly uniform dot firmness for extended reading ergonomics.
	\item \textbf{Dot Pad X / Monarch / Graphiti:} Multi-line + \gidx{tactilegraphics}{tactile graphics} modalities for STEM diagrams, spatial data.
	\item \textbf{Brailliant BI X Line:} On-device Wi‑Fi sync + \gls{tts} layer for hybrid auditory-tactile workflow.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Next Steps / Open Items}
\begin{itemize}
	\item If desired, migrate consolidated differentiators directly into table footnotes using tabularray \texttt{note} + superscripts (requires reflow; advise confirming braille translation impact).
	\item Provide glossary definitions for any unresolved \texttt{\\gls\{\}} entries to clear the remaining “undefined reference” diagnostic.
	\item Optionally normalize pricing bands with current MSRP verification logs for audit traceability.
\end{itemize}
