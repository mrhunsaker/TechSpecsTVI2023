\subsection{Evaluation Criteria}
Applications are evaluated based on latency, feature completeness, compatibility with assistive technologies, and user satisfaction\supercite{Smith2022, Jones2021}.

\section{Performance Analysis}
\subsection{Latency and Responsiveness}
Measured latency and responsiveness are critical for user experience. Applications with lower latency and real-time feedback are preferred by print-disabled users\supercite{Doe2020}. Hardware limitations, such as insufficient RAM or outdated processors, can significantly degrade performance.

\subsection{Compatibility with Assistive Technologies}
Integration with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack) and braille displays is essential. Applications that natively support these technologies provide a more seamless experience.

\section{User Experience}
\subsection{Feedback from Print-Disabled Individuals}
Surveys and interviews indicate that users prioritize reliability, ease of navigation, and customization options. Frustration arises when applications fail to deliver consistent performance or lack essential accessibility features\supercite{Doe2020}.

\subsection{Barriers to Access}
Common barriers include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Inadequate hardware resources (RAM, CPU)
	\item Poor screen reader integration
	\item Limited support for accessible file formats
	\item High cost of premium applications
\end{itemize}

\section{Recommendations}
\subsection{Immediate Interventions - Equity-Focused Approach}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ensure minimum hardware requirements (16GB RAM, modern CPU) for educational and personal devices.
	\item Prioritize applications with proven screen reader compatibility.
	\item Advocate for open standards and affordable solutions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long-term Solutions - Civil Rights Compliance}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Promote development of universally accessible applications.
	\item Encourage policy changes to mandate accessibility in educational technology procurement.
	\item Support ongoing research into latency reduction and user-centered design.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}
Accessible digital reading applications are vital for print-disabled individuals. Ensuring equitable access requires attention to hardware, software, and user experience. Continued advocacy and technological innovation are necessary to close the equity gap.
