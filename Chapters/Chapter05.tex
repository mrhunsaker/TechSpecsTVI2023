In the ever-evolving realms of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM)\index{STEM}, the pursuit of literacy takes on a particularly intricate form. For visually impaired students\index{students with visual impairments}, the challenges are multifaceted, but with the advent of 3D printing\index{3D printing}, a transformative bridge has been constructed. This chapter explores the indispensable role that 3D printed materials\index{3D printing!materials} play in shaping the educational narrative of visually impaired students. These technologies, with their ability to translate complex concepts and data into tangible models, foster literacy, comprehension, and success across the curriculum.\supercite{DassaultEducation, TechLearning2023, TeachThought2021}

The crux of this exploration lies in recognizing the nuanced requirements of visually impaired students. Traditional learning often relies on visual aids that are inaccessible. 3D printing\index{3D printing} bridges this gap, converting abstract concepts into tangible formats, empowering students to actively engage with and comprehend the intricacies of any subject.

\section{3D Printers}\label{ch5:sec:3d-printers}
When selecting a 3D printer\index{3D printing!printers} for students with visual impairments, it is important to consider the following features:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Tactile printing\index{3D printing!tactile printing}:} The printer should produce 3D models that are tactile and easily understood by students with visual impairments.
	\item \textbf{High resolution:} The printer should produce high-resolution models with fine details.
	\item \textbf{Ease of use:} The printer should be easy to use, set up, and maintain.
	\item \textbf{Compatibility:} The printer should be compatible with a wide range of software and file formats.
	\item \textbf{Cost:} The printer should be affordable and within the school or institution's budget.
	\item \textbf{Safety features:} Enclosed designs and automatic bed leveling for safer operation in educational environments.
	\item \textbf{Reliability:} Consistent performance with minimal maintenance requirements.
\end{itemize}

3D printing can help visually impaired students learn a variety of disciplines such as engineering, manufacturing, food, art, and health \supercite{Karbowski2020}. 3D printed models can benefit both blind and sighted students, allowing for multisensory learning and independence \supercite{MatterHackers2017}.
