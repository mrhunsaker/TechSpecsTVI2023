\chapter{Amplifying Vision: The Vital Role of Video Magnification Products in Fostering Literacy and Success for Visually Impaired Students}\label{low-vision}

In the realm of visual impairment, the quest for literacy and academic success is a journey characterized by innovation and adaptability. For visually impaired students, the challenge of accessing printed materials, charts, and visual content is met with a powerful solution—video magnification products. The indispensable role that video magnification plays in providing enhanced visual access, breaking down barriers to literacy, and empowering students to navigate the educational landscape with confidence cannot be overstated.

The significance of video magnification products lies in their ability to transform the visual experience for students with visual impairments. As we navigate this chapter, we will unravel the sophisticated functionalities of these devices, showcasing how they go beyond traditional magnification methods to provide an immersive and dynamic visual experience. Whether exploring the pages of a textbook, deciphering intricate diagrams, or engaging with digital content, video magnification stands as a technological ally, ensuring that every student can access and interpret visual information with ease.

The video magnification market has experienced substantial growth, with the assistive technologies for visual impairment market valued at USD 125.84 million in 2023 and projected to reach USD 134.21 million in 2024, eventually growing to USD 224.58 million by 2032. This growth is driven by technological advancements including artificial intelligence integration, augmented reality capabilities, and enhanced portability features that make these devices increasingly accessible to students.

In the pursuit of literacy, the role of video magnification becomes increasingly pivotal, particularly in subjects where visual content is integral to comprehension. This chapter will delve into how these products facilitate not only enhanced readability but also active participation in classroom discussions, visual learning activities, and the overall educational experience. Modern video magnification devices now incorporate AI-powered features such as JAWS Picture Smart AI, which provides detailed image descriptions, revolutionizing accessibility for visually impaired students.

By providing visually impaired students with a clear and magnified view of the visual world, video magnification products serve as gateways to knowledge, fostering a sense of inclusion and leveling the playing field in academic settings. It is evident that these tools are not mere aids; they are essential components in the arsenal of resources necessary for the success of visually impaired students. Video magnification imperatively contributes to shaping a learning environment where visual content is accessible to all, ensuring that literacy and success are attainable goals for every student, regardless of their visual abilities.

\section{Video Magnification Devices}\label{video-magnification-devices}

When purchasing electronic portable magnifiers for students with visual impairments, it is important to consider the following factors to ensure that they can access a free and appropriate public education\footnote{\emph{cf}., \href{http://www.perkins.org/resource/choosing-appropriate-video-magnifier/}{Perkins School for the Blind. (n.d.). Choosing an appropriate video magnifier. Retrieved December 19, 2023}}:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{Magnification power}: The magnification power of the magnifier should be appropriate for the student's needs. Some magnifiers have a fixed magnification, while others have adjustable magnification. Modern systems can magnify content from 2x to 85x times its original size while maintaining perfect focus.
 \item \emph{Portability}: Portable magnifiers are ideal for students who need to move around the classroom or school. They should be lightweight and easy to carry. Battery life is an important consideration for portable magnifiers. The battery should last long enough to get through a school day without needing to be recharged.
 \item \emph{Ease of use}: The magnifier should be easy to use and adjust. It should have large buttons and controls that are easy to locate and operate. Compatibility with other assistive technology devices, such as screen readers and braille displays, is also important.
 \item \emph{AI and Advanced Features}: Latest trends in low vision magnifiers for 2024 include AI integration, augmented reality, wearable devices, and enhanced connectivity features, which can significantly enhance the learning experience for students.
 \item \emph{Cost}: The cost of the magnifier should be reasonable and within the school's budget. The American Recovery Plan Act provides funds to libraries and schools to address student learning loss and assist with distance learning through assistive technologyAI-powered devices like MyEye Pro use voice-activated, intuitive AI to audibly describe what's in a room, respond to open-ended queries for specific information, and help users recognize faces.
 \item \emph{Wearable Technology}: Smart glasses and head-mounted displays are becoming increasingly sophisticated, offering hands-free magnification and real-time text-to-speech capabilities.
 \item \emph{Enhanced Connectivity}: Modern devices feature improved wireless connectivity, allowing seamless integration with classroom technology and remote learning platforms.
 \item \emph{Augmented Reality}: AR capabilities are being integrated into magnification devices to provide contextual information and enhanced visual overlays.
