This tool can also summarize message conversations, such as lengthy email threads, significantly improving information retention and overall productivity.\footnote{Source: \url{https://accessiblepharmacy.com/top-10-ai-tools-for-the-blind-and-visually-impaired/}}

AI-powered workplace tools are moving beyond basic accessibility features, such as traditional screen readers, to actively augment productivity and enable visually impaired professionals to participate fully and independently in collaborative and information-intensive environments. This effectively levels the professional playing field by compensating for visual barriers in real-time, fostering greater independence, efficiency, and opportunities for career advancement. Professional work often involves complex tasks such as drafting, summarizing, real-time communication, and multilingual interaction. Traditional assistive technologies frequently required workarounds or human assistance for these functions. AI's role in augmentation means Copilot automates tasks and suggests content, making the user more efficient, not just able to access information. Live transcription in Teams ensures full participation in dynamic meetings. Read AI Meeting notes\footnote{Source: \url{https://accessiblepharmacy.com/top-10-ai-tools-for-the-blind-and-visually-impaired/}} addresses the challenge of capturing and summarizing spoken information, a critical professional skill. This signifies a shift from merely "accommodating" disability to actively "empowering" professionals. AI acts as a force multiplier, allowing visually impaired individuals to perform at higher levels, take on more complex roles, and compete more effectively in the modern workforce, reducing or eliminating the need for human intermediaries for many tasks.

\subsubsection{Accessibility Feedback Analysis}

The "Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Accessibility" initiative represents a strategic application of AI focused on enhancing digital accessibility. This project primarily utilizes NLP to analyze large volumes of social media interactions and bug reports. The core objective is to extract and synthesize actionable insights from user-generated content to improve accessibility features in software applications, with a particular focus on individuals with visual disabilities or eye conditions.\footnote{Source: \url{https://wajdialjedaani.com/projects/project.html?id=project3}}

Key objectives of this project include developing sophisticated NLP tools capable of automatically extracting and classifying accessibility-related feedback. This involves analyzing how software updates impact app accessibility over time by studying user reviews and feedback trends. Furthermore, the initiative aims to create advanced NLP-driven reporting tools that empower developers to rapidly identify common issues and emerging trends in accessibility. This systematic approach helps developers understand the broader ramifications of their modifications and enables more responsive and informed development practices, ensuring that accessibility is maintained or improved with each update.\footnote{Source: \url{https://wajdialjedaani.com/projects/project.html?id=project3}}

A critical aspect of this initiative is the integration of human expertise with automated NLP analysis. This involves collaborative efforts with accessibility experts and direct engagement with the visually impaired community. This participatory approach refines the accuracy and relevance of the NLP tools, ensuring that the developed solutions are not only technologically sound but also practically beneficial and genuinely responsive to the needs of users with disabilities.\footnote{Source: \url{https://wajdialjedaani.com/projects/project.html?id=project3}} Beyond structured feedback, NLP can also be leveraged to improve accessibility by analyzing user feedback through sentiment analysis, enabling organizations to understand the nuanced needs and concerns of users with disabilities, even when expressed indirectly.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ultimate-guide-nlp-accessibility}}

The application of NLP to systematically analyze accessibility feedback represents a crucial closed-loop system for continuous improvement in assistive technology design. By leveraging user-generated insights, this approach allows developers to proactively identify and address instances where AI systems "misfit" the needs of disabled users. This ensures that future AI solutions are truly human-centered and evolve responsively to the diverse and dynamic needs of the visually impaired community, thereby driving truly inclusive innovation. This creates a virtuous cycle: AI helps identify problems with AI's accessibility, leading to better AI. It ensures that the development process is not static but continuously informed by the lived experiences of visually impaired users. This systematic feedback loop is critical for bridging the gap between design intent and actual user experience, leading to more robust, equitable, and truly inclusive AI solutions over time.

\section{AI and LLM in Recreation and Leisure}

\subsection{Accessible Gaming}

The emergence of AI and LLM technologies is significantly expanding the accessibility of gaming for blind and low-vision (BLV) players, a domain traditionally challenging due to its heavy reliance on visual elements. GamerAstra, a generalized accessibility framework, exemplifies this advancement by leveraging a multi-agent AI design to facilitate access to video games that may lack native accessibility support. This framework integrates multi-modal techniques, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), to translate visual game experiences into rich, descriptive audio and textual narratives.\footnote{Source: \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22937}; \url{https://www.aimodels.fyi/papers/arxiv/gamerastra-enhancing-video-game-accessibility-blind-low}; \url{https://arxiv.org/html/2506.22937v1}; \url{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/374526766_Accessible_Play_Towards_Designing_a_Framework_for_Customizable_Accessibility_in_Games}}

GamerAstra’s architecture includes specialized AI agents such as a Scene Parsing Agent, an Action Interpretation Agent, and a Narrative Generation Agent. These agents work concurrently to analyze game environments in real-time, describe detailed spatial and action-based information, and provide contextual guidance, akin to a helpful co-player. The system generates real-time audio cues for gaming feedback, enhances players' spatial sense, and assists with positional accuracy for interactions like targeting objects. It also supports various navigation and action execution methods, including keyboard arrow keys and hotkey actions, to accommodate different player preferences and degrees of visual impairment.\footnote{Source: \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22937}; \url{https://arxiv.org/html/2506.22937v1}} This signifies a breakthrough in making video games more inclusive by leveraging AI to translate visual game experiences into rich, descriptive audio and textual narratives, thereby dramatically improving gaming experiences.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.aimodels.fyi/papers/arxiv/gamerastra-enhancing-video-game-accessibility-blind-low}}

Beyond dedicated frameworks, accessible mobile games are also leveraging AI principles. Dice World, a collection of dice games, offers universally accessible tutorials and allows players to compete against AI characters or other players, with full VoiceOver accessibility and custom interfaces.\footnote{Source: \url{https://vi.ie/david-redmond-investigates-accessible-audio-games/}} Frequency Missing is an audio story game that uses directional sounds to guide players, featuring full voice acting.\footnote{Source: \url{https://vi.ie/david-redmond-investigates-accessible-audio-games/}} Audio Game Hub provides a collection of audio-based games, from disarming bombs to casino games, all played through sound with voice acting and sound effects.\footnote{Source: \url{https://vi.ie/david-redmond-investigates-accessible-audio-games/}} Pitch Black, A Dusk Light Story, is another audio story app that uses sound to guide movement, relying entirely on sound design for immersion.\footnote{Source: \url{https://vi.ie/david-redmond-investigates-accessible-audio-games/}} These games demonstrate how AI-driven audio design and intelligent game mechanics can create immersive experiences without visual dependency.\footnote{Source: \url{https://vi.ie/david-redmond-investigates-accessible-audio-games/}}

\subsection{Creative Arts and Music}

AI is democratizing creative expression for blind individuals, lowering traditional barriers in artistic and musical pursuits. For visual arts, AI tools are enabling new forms of art specifically designed for visually impaired individuals. Generative AI models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and image style algorithms, can enhance accessibility by generating detailed audio descriptions or tactile representations of visual art. A blind creative noted how AI has transformed their ability to detect colors accurately, understand patterns, and receive minute descriptions of videos and images, which has been invaluable for historical costume research and other visual analyses.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI71DRqcAtI&vl=id}; \url{https://pixel-gallery.co.uk/blogs/pixelated-stories/ai-art-for-the-visually-impaired}} Adobe Firefly, an AI image generator, allows users to describe a desired image via text prompts, and the AI generates several options, empowering blind content creators to produce visual content through textual input.\footnote{Source: \url{https://accessiblepharmacy.com/top-10-ai-tools-for-the-blind-and-visually-impaired/}}

In music, AI is equally transformative. Google's Music AI Sandbox, powered by their Lyria 2 model, offers experimental tools developed in collaboration with musicians. This suite allows users to generate musical ideas simply by describing them in text prompts, overcoming physical limitations that might hinder playing traditional instruments or navigating complex digital audio workstations (DAWs).\footnote{Source: \url{https://assistivetechnologyblog.com/2025/05/google-music-ai-sandbox-accessibility-disabilities.html}} For instance, users can request specific instruments or evoke moods and genres through language, translating creative visions into sound without complex physical interaction. The platform also allows for editing AI-generated music by transforming sections and adding new lyrical content, fostering unprecedented creative freedom.\footnote{Source: \url{https://assistivetechnologyblog.com/2025/05/google-music-ai-sandbox-accessibility-disabilities.html}} One blind artist described how AI tools allow for uploading a video and receiving an audio description of it, enabling them to create audio-described music videos.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09YyhOkg8xg}} This integration of advanced AI models elevates existing assistive technologies, allowing AI to understand and interpret a wider range of inputs, generate more sophisticated musical outputs, and personalize the creative process.\footnote{Source: \url{https://assistivetechnologyblog.com/2025/05/google-music-ai-sandbox-accessibility-disabilities.html}}

\subsection{Sports and Physical Activities}

AI and LLM technologies are making significant contributions to enhancing participation in sports and physical activities for visually impaired individuals, acting as a "sighted guide" in many contexts.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.lexgillette.com/articles/paralympian-lex-gillettes-top-7-ai-tools-for-accessibility}} The Touch2See system, developed by a French startup, is a revolutionary technological innovation that allows blind or partially sighted people to follow football matches and other sports in an immersive and autonomous way. This system uses a tablet that reproduces a miniature playing field, where a small magnetic disk moves in real-time to allow users to follow actions with their fingers. Variations in vibration intensity indicate the importance of game actions. Touch2See combines haptic feedback with audio descriptions, providing a dedicated commentator who narrates the match with extraordinary detail, including actions, atmosphere, and crowd reactions. This system leverages ultra-fast analysis of sports data via AI and 5G technology, ensuring immediate information updates with a latency of just 0.15 seconds.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.embedded.com/touch2see-making-sports-accessible-to-blind-people/}}

Microsoft's Seeing AI, while primarily for daily living, also functions as a valuable tool in sports by helping users understand their surroundings, read signage, and identify objects in real-time, which can be crucial for navigating sports venues or understanding game environments.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.lexgillette.com/articles/paralympian-lex-gillettes-top-7-ai-tools-for-accessibility}} Paralympian Lex Gillette utilizes various Microsoft AI tools, including Seeing AI and Copilot, to manage his daily life, training, and professional engagements, demonstrating how AI can open up experiences once inaccessible without human assistance.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.lexgillette.com/articles/paralympian-lex-gillettes-top-7-ai-tools-for-accessibility}}

While not exclusively AI-driven, many adaptive sports and activities for the visually impaired incorporate technological adaptations that could be enhanced by AI. These include using sound-emitting balls for sports like soccer or bowling, and audio navigation tools for hiking. AI could further refine these by providing more precise auditory cues or real-time environmental descriptions, enhancing safety and participation.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.brightfocus.org/resource/tips-for-playing-sports-with-low-vision/}; \url{https://www.iamhable.com/blogs/article/the-best-hobbies-for-the-visually-impaired-a-2025-guide-to-fun-fulfillment}}

\section{Challenges and Ethical Considerations}

While AI and LLM technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for enhancing accessibility for the blind and visually impaired, their widespread adoption is accompanied by significant technical limitations and complex ethical considerations that require careful attention.

\subsection{Technical Limitations}

Current AI systems, particularly those relying on computer vision, demonstrate high recognition accuracy rates (85-95\%) for common objects and text in controlled environments. However, this performance often drops significantly (to 60-75\%) in challenging real-world conditions characterized by poor lighting, complex scenes, or diverse object presentations. This performance gap underscores the critical need for more robust systems that can operate reliably across varied and unpredictable environments.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.aimodels.fyi/papers/arxiv/ai-powered-assistive-technologies-visual-impairment}}

Response time is another crucial factor impacting the utility of these devices. User studies indicate that feedback delays exceeding 1.5 seconds significantly diminish the usefulness of assistive technologies, particularly for real-time tasks like navigation or object detection. Achieving real-time performance for complex scene understanding remains a persistent challenge.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.aimodels.fyi/papers/arxiv/ai-powered-assistive-technologies-visual-impairment}} Furthermore, battery life continues to be a limiting factor for many wearable assistive devices, with most current solutions requiring recharging after only 3-5 hours of active use. This duration often falls short of covering a full day of activities, necessitating frequent recharging or carrying backup power.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.aimodels.fyi/papers/arxiv/ai-powered-assistive-technologies-visual-impairment}} Computational requirements also pose a challenge, as running large language models locally on portable devices often requires offloading intensive tasks to cloud services, which can introduce latency and dependency on internet connectivity.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.themoonlight.io/en/review/seesay-an-assistive-device-for-the-visually-impaired-using-retrieval-augmented-generation}}

\subsection{Data Quality and Bias}

A significant concern revolves around data quality and the inherent biases within AI models. NLP models, for instance, require vast amounts of high-quality data for effective training and improvement. However, collecting and annotating data specifically for accessibility purposes can be challenging, particularly for low-resource languages or highly specialized domains.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ultimate-guide-nlp-accessibility}} AI models can also be prone to bias and inaccuracies if their training data is not representative of diverse user groups or contains existing societal biases. This can result in suboptimal performance and a negative user experience, leading to what is termed "misfitting" in computer vision systems.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ultimate-guide-nlp-accessibility}; \url{https://rahaf.info/data/ASSETS2024.pdf}; \url{https://www.researchgate.net/publication/385286169_Misfitting_With_AI_How_Blind_People_Verify_and_Contest_AI_Errors}}

The concept of "misfitting" highlights that AI technologies are predominantly built for sighted individuals using sighted data, leading to systems that may not adequately support the unique needs and lived experiences of blind users. This is particularly evident when AI Visual Assistance Technologies (AI VAT) fail to support complex document layouts, diverse languages, or cultural artifacts, causing an additional layer of misfitting for blind individuals who hold marginalized identities.\footnote{Source: \url{https://rahaf.info/data/ASSETS2024.pdf}; \url{https://arxiv.org/html/2408.06546v1}} For example, GenAI tools have been observed to struggle with nuanced concepts about disability, sometimes producing stereotypical characterizations (e.g., describing blind people as 'courageous' or 'resilient') or even expressing pity (e.g., "I'm sorry, you're blind"), which can be frustrating for users.\footnote{Source: \url{https://maitraye.github.io/files/papers/BLV_GenAI_ASSETS24.pdf}} Participants in studies hypothesize that biased datasets, often created by non-disabled people, are a key reason for such ableist and inappropriate GenAI responses.\footnote{Source: \url{https://maitraye.github.io/files/papers/BLV_GenAI_ASSETS24.pdf}} Concerns also extend to biased portrayals of race and gender, such as misgendering or inaccuracies in low-resource languages due to underrepresentation in datasets.\footnote{Source: \url{https://maitraye.github.io/files/papers/BLV_GenAI_ASSETS24.pdf}}

\subsection{Accessibility of AI Interfaces}

Even with powerful AI capabilities, the user interfaces of GenAI tools can present significant accessibility challenges for blind individuals. Users have reported that buttons for common actions like copying, regenerating, or downvoting responses in tools like ChatGPT are often unlabeled, forcing them to guess functions through trial and error. Furthermore, many GenAI interfaces, such as ChatGPT and Claude, lack appropriate heading labels, regions, or landmarks for screen reader users, making it difficult to quickly navigate conversations. Users often resort to "brute force" methods, scrolling through entire conversations with arrow keys to find responses or type new prompts.\footnote{Source: \url{https://maitraye.github.io/files/papers/BLV_GenAI_ASSETS24.pdf}}

Users of Copilot and Bard have expressed frustration with extraneous sample prompts and advertisements, which create "a lot of clutter to sort through" before reaching the chat fields. Additionally, blind users often do not receive immediate notifications when the system finishes generating a response, requiring them to actively "dig for it" by moving their screen reader focus. While some of these issues might affect sighted users, their impact is magnified for blind individuals using screen readers, which can significantly slow down the interaction and make the experience frustrating.\footnote{Source: \url{https://maitraye.github.io/files/papers/BLV_GenAI_ASSETS24.pdf}}

\subsection{Verification and Trust}

A critical challenge for blind users of AI VAT is verifying the accuracy of AI-generated outputs, especially when the information is visual and cannot be independently confirmed. GenAI tools frequently provide fabricated, inaccurate, or inconsistent information, a phenomenon known as "hallucinations." For instance, Be My AI might misidentify a raincoat pattern, or ChatGPT might replace a user's name with a fictitious one.\footnote{Source: \url{https://maitraye.github.io/files/papers/BLV_GenAI_ASSETS24.pdf}} A significant issue is that GenAI tools often project "confidence" in their inaccurate responses, particularly concerning visual information, which can be highly misleading for blind users who cannot visually verify the information.\footnote{Source: \url{https://maitraye.github.io/files/papers/BLV_GenAI_ASSETS24.pdf}}

Blind participants attempt to identify inaccuracies by sensing if responses "sounded really weird" or were "very different" from their expectations. They resort to external verification methods, such as "turning to Google" or consulting reliable websites. They also try to verify by repeating questions to the same tool or using multiple GenAI tools to check for consistent responses. "Deductive reasoning" is employed by asking follow-up questions to judge accuracy or completeness. The decision to verify depends on the context of use (e.g., medical, financial, professional information requires high verification), the stakes involved (higher stakes necessitate more rigorous verification), the ease of verifiability (which is harder for blind users without sighted help), and the believability of the information. The richness and detail of GenAI responses, while beneficial for access, can be a "double-edged sword," as they also increase the likelihood of trusting inaccurate information.\footnote{Source: \url{https://maitraye.github.io/files/papers/BLV_GenAI_ASSETS24.pdf}}

\subsection{Privacy and Data Security}

Concerns regarding privacy are substantial, with 78\% of users expressing worries about continuous recording in public spaces and the security of their personal data.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.aimodels.fyi/papers/arxiv/ai-powered-assistive-technologies-visual-impairment}} Users have limited understanding of how GenAI tools store and use their information, leading to apprehension about privacy, especially given the ability to retrieve previous chat history.\footnote{Source: \url{https://maitraye.github.io/files/papers/BLV_GenAI_ASSETS24.pdf}} The proliferation of misinformation, disinformation, deep fake videos, and voice cloning scams facilitated by GenAI also raises concerns among users, who exercise caution before using GenAI responses in publicly shared content to avoid "creating more fake news".\footnote{Source: \url{https://maitraye.github.io/files/papers/BLV_GenAI_ASSETS24.pdf}}


\subsection{Ethical Imperatives}

Ensuring that AI systems are accessible to everyone, regardless of their abilities, is not merely a moral obligation but also a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, such as the European Union's Accessibility Act and the United States' Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ethics-ai-accessibility-matters}} The moral argument for accessible AI is rooted in the principles of equality and non-discrimination, asserting that people with disabilities should have equal access to the benefits and opportunities provided by AI technologies.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ethics-ai-accessibility-matters}} Inaccessible AI systems can exacerbate existing inequalities by excluding individuals with disabilities from fully participating in society.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ethics-ai-accessibility-matters}}

Key practices for ensuring accessibility in AI development include integrating accessibility considerations early in the development process, conducting accessibility audits, incorporating accessibility features into design and testing phases, and ensuring compatibility with assistive technologies like screen readers.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ultimate-guide-nlp-accessibility}; \url{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/ai-and-accessibility-a-discussion-of-ethical-considerations/}; \url{https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ethics-ai-accessibility-matters}} Engaging with users with disabilities throughout the development process is crucial for creating truly accessible AI. This involves conducting user research to understand diverse needs, involving users in usability testing, and collaborating with disability organizations to gain insights and feedback.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/ai-and-accessibility-a-discussion-of-ethical-considerations/}; \url{https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ethics-ai-accessibility-matters}} Continuous improvement is also vital, requiring regular updates to AI systems for compatibility with the latest assistive technologies, monitoring user feedback for emerging issues, and continuously evaluating and improving the accessibility of AI algorithms and models.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ethics-ai-accessibility-matters}} The development of AI must be guided by the principles of inclusivity and respect for human rights.\footnote{Source: \url{https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/ethics-ai-accessibility-matters}}
\section{The Imperative of Locally Hosted LLMs for Privacy and Accessibility}

While cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs) offer convenience and scalability, their reliance on external servers introduces significant privacy and accessibility challenges. For a truly inclusive and secure AI ecosystem, the availability and adoption of locally hosted LLMs through services and frameworks like `llamafile`, `llama.cpp`, and `Ollama` become paramount.

\subsection{Privacy Considerations}
A primary concern with cloud-based LLMs is data privacy. When users interact with these models, their inputs, queries, and often the generated outputs are transmitted to and processed by third-party servers. This raises questions about:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Data Security and Confidentiality:} Sensitive personal information, medical data, financial details, or proprietary business information processed by cloud LLMs could be at risk of breaches or unauthorized access by the service provider or other malicious actors.
