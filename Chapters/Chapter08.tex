\raggedright
In the pursuit of independence\index{independence} and safety\index{safety}, orientation and mobility training holds a pivotal place in the educational journey of visually impaired students. In this dynamic landscape, accessible GPS\index{GPS} equipment emerges as a technological beacon, offering a transformative bridge to mobility, autonomy, and enhanced safety. This chapter explores the indispensable role that accessible GPS tools\index{sonification!tools} play in empowering visually impaired students for success, ensuring safe navigation through the world, and fostering a sense of confidence in their daily lives.

The quest for \gls{independence} is intricately tied to the ability to navigate and explore the surrounding environment. For visually impaired students, this journey is often met with challenges that extend beyond the typical obstacles encountered in education. Accessible \gls{gps} equipment becomes a critical ally, providing not only the means to explore the world independently but also enhancing \gls{safety} through reliable navigational assistance.

As we delve into this chapter, we will explore the functionalities of accessible GPS devices tailored to the unique needs of visually impaired users. From real-time audible\index{audiobook!Audible} directions to haptic feedback\index{haptic feedback} systems, these tools extend beyond standard navigation, creating a multi-sensory experience that empowers students to traverse their surroundings confidently. The importance of this technology\index{technology} is accentuated during orientation and mobility\index{orientation \& mobility!orientation and mobility} training, where students learn not only to navigate physical spaces but also to develop crucial skills for safety\index{safety} and situational awareness\index{situational awareness} \supercite{OrientationMobilityInstruction}.
