\chapter{Transformative Tablets: Pioneering Success for Visually Impaired Students Through Innovative Apps}\label{ios-devices}

In an era where technology shapes the landscape of education, tablets have emerged as transformative tools, providing visually impaired students with unprecedented access to knowledge and fostering independence in their academic journeys.\footnote{I am omitting iPhone and Android phones from this document as the purchase of student phones is beyond the purview of a school district. However, iOS apps are provided as many of these are available on both Tablets and Phones and training students to use the technology on their personal device is often necessary, particularly within the auspice of Orientation \& Mobility instruction} Both iPad and Android devices offer user-friendly interfaces and a diverse array of applications specifically tailored to bridge the accessibility gap. This chapter explores how tablets, in tandem with purpose-built apps, are not just tools but catalysts for success in the educational journey of visually impaired students.

Tablets serve as dynamic portals for visually impaired learners, offering a multi-sensory approach to engagement. Their unique functionalities, combined with a robust ecosystem of accessibility apps, empower students to navigate the digital realm with confidence and independence.

\section{Tablet Considerations}\label{tablet-considerations}

When selecting a tablet for students with visual impairments, consider the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Accessibility features:} Ensure compatibility with screen readers and magnification tools (e.g., VoiceOver for iOS, TalkBack for Android).\footnote{Traditionally, assistive technology for the blind has focused on the iPad line since the Android line had historically lagged behind the Apple products for accessibility features prior to 2020 so accessibility apps have favored the iOS/iPadOS architecture. However, groups are emerging that specifically instruct users of Android devices how to access and use accessibility settings \emph{cf.}, \href{http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvEM-SmpwElNALldhp8hG1g}{Blind Android Users}}
    \item \emph{Tactile features, size, and weight:} Choose a device that accommodates the student's specific needs.
    \item \emph{Contrast and color settings:} High contrast and customizable color settings, as well as text-to-speech functionalities, enhance readability.
    \item \emph{Screen size:} Larger screens can help reduce visual fatigue and improve usability, but balance with portability.
    \item \emph{App compatibility:} Ensure the device supports a variety of educational and accessibility apps.
    \item \emph{Visual fatigue:} Avoid prioritizing brightness; instead, focus on resolution and screen area. Adjust luminance for students with photophobia.
\end{itemize}

Contrast ratio is especially important for students with visual impairments. Understanding and prioritizing contrast ratio helps foster an inclusive and enriching educational environment.

\section{Tablet Options}\label{tab:tablet-options}
When choosing an Android Tablet or iPad for a student with visual impairments, several factors must be considered to ensure that the student receives free and appropriate public education. The first factor to consider is the screen contrast ratio. A high contrast ratio is essential for students with visual impairments as it makes it easier for them to read text and view images on the screen. For Android Tablets, the W3C recommends a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for small text and 3.0:1 for large text\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/7158390?hl=en}{Google. (n.d.). Color contrast - Android Accessibility Help. Retrieved December 19, 2023}}. On the other hand, Apple devices have an “Increase Contrast” feature that can be turned on to make text and other elements more visible\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://www.imore.com/how-increase-contrast-visual-accessibility-iphone-and-ipad}{iMore. (n.d.). How to increase contrast for visual accessibility on iPhone and iPad. Retrieved December 19, 2023}}.

The second factor to consider is the size of the screen. A larger screen is beneficial for students with visual impairments as it allows them to view text and images more clearly. Tablets usually have larger screens than smartphones, making them a better choice for students with visual impairments\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/cell-phones-tablets-mobile/smartphone-or-tablet-which}{American Foundation for the Blind. (n.d.). Smartphone or Tablet: Which is Best for You? Retrieved December 19, 2023}}. However, it is important to note that larger screens come at the expense of portability. Therefore, it is essential to find a balance between screen size and portability.

The third factor to consider is the availability of accessible apps. Both Android and iOS devices have built-in accessibility features such as screen readers, magnifiers, and high contrast modes \footnote{\raggedright \href{https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/low-vision-impairment-apps-tech-assistive-devices }{American Academy of Ophthalmology. (n.d.). 30 Apps, Devices and Technologies for People With Vision Impairments. Retrieved December 19, 2023}}\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/cell-phones-tablets-mobile/apple-ios-iphone-and-ipad }{American Foundation for the Blind. (n.d.). Apple iOS for iPhone and iPad: Considerations for Users with Visual Impairments. Retrieved December 19, 2023}}. Additionally, there are several apps available that are specifically designed for students with visual impairments. For example, the “Lookout” app for Android provides spoken feedback about things around you, while the “Be My Eyes” app connects visually-impaired people with sighted volunteers through a live video call\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/technology-apps-devices-children-blind-low-vision}{American Academy of Ophthalmology. (n.d.). Technology Tools for Children with Low Vision. Retrieved December 19, 2023}}. It is important to ensure that the device has access to these apps to ensure that the student can receive free and appropriate public education.

\section{Mobile Applications}\label{tab:tablelet-apps}
Mobile apps run on tablets are becoming increasingly important for students with visual impairments to access a free and appropriate public education. These apps can provide students with access to digital content, assistive technology, and other tools that can help them succeed in their studies. High-quality mobile apps can help students with visual impairments access the same educational materials as their sighted peers and participate fully in the curriculum. They can also help improve literacy skills, comprehension, and productivity. In this section, we will explore the importance of high-quality mobile apps for students with visual impairments and discuss some of the best apps available on the market today. \emph{Table \ref{tab:table10}} gives a list of current apps available for use with students with visual impairments.
