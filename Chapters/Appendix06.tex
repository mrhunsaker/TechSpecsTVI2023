\section{Defining Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)}\label{sec:defining-aac}

AAC encompasses a broad range of methods used to supplement or replace spoken or written communication for individuals with communication disorders  \cite{ASHA}. These methods can be unaided, relying on the individualâ€™s body (e.g., gestures, manual signs), or aided, requiring external tools or devices. For individuals with visual impairments, blindness, and/or deafblindness, aided AAC often involves tactile, auditory, or multi-modal approaches. The goal of AAC is to enable individuals to communicate effectively, participate in daily life, and express their thoughts, needs, and desires  \cite{ASHA}.

\subsection{General Principles of AAC Assessment and Intervention}\label{subsec:aac-principles}

Effective AAC implementation begins with a thorough assessment of an individual's strengths, needs, and preferred communication modalities. This often involves observing communication attempts, evaluating sensory capabilities, and considering motor skills for accessing communication tools, including the use of \textbf{switch-based communication}  \cite{ASHA}. Intervention strategies are highly individualized, focusing on teaching the individual how to use their AAC system, as well as educating communication partners on how to interpret and respond to AAC messages  \cite{ASHA}. The ultimate aim is to facilitate meaningful communication in various environments.

\section{Foundational AAC Strategies and Theoretical Frameworks in Training}\label{sec:aac-strategies}

Many programs emphasize foundational communication strategies that are particularly vital for individuals with sensory impairments. These include establishing cause-and-effect, fostering intentional communication, and developing symbolic understanding through multi-sensory experiences.

\subsection{Touch for Connection and Communication}\label{subsec:touch-connection}

Tactile interaction is paramount for individuals who are deafblind. Training often focuses on developing communication through touch, including body language, natural gestures, and haptic cues. The Helen Keller National Center (HKNC) offers dedicated training on this, emphasizing how touch can convey information about people, objects, and the environment  \cite{HKNC_Haptics}. This foundational skill is critical for building a bridge to more complex symbolic communication.

\subsection{Progressing from Non-symbolic to Symbolic Communication}\label{subsec:progress-symbolic}

Instructional programs guide learners from pre-symbolic communication (e.g., crying, body movements, changes in muscle tone) to symbolic communication using objects, pictures, or tactile symbols. This progression is often non-linear and tailored to the individual's cognitive and sensory development. The University of South Dakota's DeafBlind Communication Strategies course covers this journey, focusing on developing abstract thought and language concepts  \cite{USD}.

\subsection{Object Communication Systems}\label{subsec:object-comm}

Object communication systems are a highly effective low-tech AAC strategy, particularly for individuals with significant visual impairments or deafblindness. These systems use real objects or miniature objects to represent concepts, activities, or choices. For example, a spoon might represent "eat" or "lunch." Training emphasizes associating the object with its meaning through consistent pairing and naturalistic experiences. The AAC Academy's "AAC \& CVI Series" specifically addresses object communication systems and their use with children in early communication phases  \cite{AACA_CVI}. The Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired (TSBVI) also champions principles of Active Learning, which inherently supports the development of object-based communication through active exploration of environments and materials  \cite{TSBVI_ActiveLearning}.

\subsection{The Universal Core Vocabulary and its Application in AAC}

The Universal Core Vocabulary is a small set of words (often 36 or 60) that makes up a large percentage of what we say and hear every day. It's designed to be portable and consistent across different communication systems. For individuals with visual impairments or deafblindness, the core vocabulary can be represented through tactile symbols or 3D printed objects. Project Core provides resources for teaching this vocabulary, emphasizing its application in natural communication contexts  \cite{ProjectCore}. Organizations like Volksswitch and Makers Making Change have significantly expanded on this concept by offering accessible and expandable sets of tactile symbols, directly addressing the need for broader vocabulary while maintaining the core principles  \cite{Volksswitch_Bliss}.

\section{Instructional Programs for Teaching Switch-Based Communication Skills}
Teaching individuals with visual impairments, blindness, or deafblindness to use switches for communication requires specific strategies that often emphasize auditory and tactile feedback, as well as clear cause-and-effect relationships. While dedicated comprehensive courses are less common, several organizations and resources offer valuable instructional guidance.

\subsection{Foundational Principles and Progression}
Many instructional approaches emphasize a progression of switch skills, starting with basic cause-and-effect and moving towards more complex communication.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cause and Effect Activities}: Essential for introducing switches, allowing learners to understand that pressing the switch produces a predictable outcome (e.g., turning on a toy, playing a sound)  \cite{TeachingVI_Switches}.
    \item \textbf{Switch Progression Road Map}: Developed by Ian Bean and highlighted by resources like My Dynamic Therapy and Spectronics, this road map outlines a systematic progression from initial exploration to single-switch timing, two-switch scanning, and eventually more complex switch access methods  \cite{MyDynamicTherapy}. Resources like the SENICT Resource Portal provide materials to support this progression.
\item \textbf{Auditory Scanning}: For individuals with visual impairments, auditory scanning is a crucial access method. The system speaks choices aloud, and the user activates the switch when they hear their desired option. Programs focusing on CVI and motor planning for high-tech devices implicitly cover these concepts  \cite{Perkins_CVI}.
