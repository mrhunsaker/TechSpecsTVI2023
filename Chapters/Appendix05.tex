\chapter{Accessible Fonts}\label{app5:appx66}
\begin{raggedright}
	\textbf{Accessibility\index{accessibility} Note:} This appendix provides an overview and demonstration of accessible fonts\index{fonts!accessible fonts}, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses for readers with visual impairments\index{visual impairment} or reading disabilities. The structure and content have been enhanced for clarity, navigation, and accessibility\index{accessibility}, including context for each font and sample.

	Accessible typography\index{typography} is crucial for individuals with visual impairments\index{visual impairment}, such as low vision or reading disabilities like dyslexia. Accessible fonts are designed to be easy to read by a diverse audience, including people with visual impairments. The use of accessible typefaces like Atkinson Hyperlegible and APHont can significantly improve the legibility and readability of text for people with visual impairments. These typefaces have features like increased letter spacing, bold\index{Markdown!text emphasis} outlines, higher contrast ratios, and wider characters, which make them easier to read. The Section 508\index{accessibility!legal accessibility} Standards \supercite{Section508} and other regulations require sans-serif fonts\index{fonts} in certain places, and typography\index{typography} choices have a huge impact on accessibility \supercite{AccessiBe}. Selecting ADA-compliant fonts requires careful consideration of multiple factors including readability, contrast, and character differentiation \supercite{AccessiBeFonts}. By using accessible typography, textual information can be made accessible to all users, irrespective of their abilities or disabilities \supercite{ReadabilityGroup, HubSpot}.

	A variety of accessible font options are available. The following sections present each font with a summary of its accessibility\index{accessibility} features, strengths, and weaknesses, followed by a demonstration of its readability \supercite{EmptyBoxNote}.

\section{~~Atkinson Hyperlegible Font}\label{app5:sec:atkinson-hyperlegible}
\noindent
\textbf{Context:} Atkinson Hyperlegible is a proportional sans-serif font designed for maximum legibility for readers with low vision. Below are its strengths, weaknesses, and sample renderings.

\emph{Developed by \href{https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont}{the Braille\index{braille} Institute}}
\begin{raggedright}
	\emph{Strengths:} Designed specifically for low vision, excellent character differentiation (e.g., distinct 'l', 'I', '1' and '0', 'O'). Very open apertures.

	\emph{Weaknesses:} May appear wider than standard fonts\index{fonts}, potentially leading to less text per line.

\section{~~Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono}\label{app5:sec:atkinson-mono}
\noindent
\textbf{Context:} Atkinson Hyperlegible Mono is a monospaced variant, useful for coding and data tables where predictable character width is important.

\emph{Developed by \href{https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont}{the Braille Institute} (Monospaced variant)}
\begin{raggedright}
	\emph{Strengths:} Retains the excellent character distinctiveness of its proportional counterpart. Monospaced nature can aid users who benefit from predictable character widths, especially for code or data.

	\emph{Weaknesses:} Monospaced fonts\index{fonts} generally take up more horizontal space, potentially reducing reading speed for some users in long prose.

\section{~~APHont}\label{app5:trouble7}
\noindent
\textbf{Context:} APHont is a sans-serif font designed by the American Printing House for the Blind\index{braille embosser!APH} for large print and low vision accessibility.

\emph{Developed by the \href{https://www.aph.org/resources/large-print-guidelines/}{American Printing House for the Blind}, \href{https://www.aph.org/resources/large-print-guidelines/}{font download here}}
\begin{raggedright}
	\emph{Strengths:} Explicitly designed for large print and low vision. Features clear, wide characters and good letter spacing.

	\emph{Weaknesses:} May appear somewhat informal due to its design. Its wide characters consume more space, which can be an issue for page count or display on smaller screens.

\section{~~Comic Sans MS}\label{app5:trouble9}
\noindent
\textbf{Context:} Comic Sans MS is an informal sans-serif font sometimes recommended for dyslexic readers, but its use is debated.

\begin{raggedright}
	\emph{Strengths:} Often cited as beneficial for some dyslexic readers due to its informal, handwritten-like characters, which can reduce visual crowding and increase character differentiation.

	\emph{Weaknesses:} Highly controversial and often considered unprofessional for formal documents. Its informal appearance can detract from the content's perceived seriousness. Not universally preferred for accessibility\index{accessibility}.

\hypertarget{trouble10}{}\section[JetBrains Mono]{JetBrains Mono \supercite{JetBrainsMono}}\label{app5:trouble10}
\noindent
\textbf{Context:} JetBrains Mono is a monospaced font designed for programming, with strong character differentiation and ligature support.

\begin{raggedright}
	\emph{Strengths:} Excellent for code readability due to clear differentiation of similar characters (e.g., '0' and 'O', 'l', 'I', '1'). Good open apertures and designed for extended screen reading. Excellent ligature support for programming.

	\emph{Weaknesses:} As a monospaced font, it's not ideal for long blocks of prose due to its uniform character width, which can make reading less fluid. Subscript characters might appear as empty boxes if the font isn't fully supported by your LaTeX\index{LaTeX} setup for these symbols.

\noindent
\textbf{Context:} Arial is a neutral, sans-serif font commonly recommended for accessibility\index{accessibility} and widely available on most systems.

\emph{Commonly recommended for accessibility due to clarity and sans-serif design. Pre-installed on many systems.}
\begin{raggedright}
	\emph{Strengths:} A widely available, neutral sans-serif font. Its familiarity and broad character set (especially Arial Unicode MS) make it a safe default for general accessibility\index{accessibility}.
