\section{~~Overview and Principles}\label{ch15:sec:overview}

\subsection{Why Accessibility Matters}\label{ch15:ssec:why-matters}
Screen reader accessibility ensures that people with visual impairments can effectively navigate, understand, and interact with digital documents. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 2.2 billion people worldwide have a vision impairment \supercite{WHO2021}. Proper accessibility benefits everyone by creating clearer, more organized content that improves usability for all users.

\subsection{Core Accessibility Principles}\label{ch15:ssec:core-principles}
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 establish four fundamental principles \supercite{WCAG2018}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Perceivable}: Information must be presentable in ways users can perceive.
	\item \textbf{Operable}: Interface components must be operable by all users.
	\item \textbf{Understandable}: Information and UI operation must be understandable.
	\item \textbf{Robust}: Content must be robust enough to work with assistive technologies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Screen Reader Basics}\label{ch15:ssec:sr-basics}
Screen readers convert digital text to speech or braille, navigating documents through structured elements. Popular screen readers include NVDA, JAWS, and VoiceOver \supercite{NVDA2023, JAWS2023, VoiceOver2023}. These tools navigate documents using:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Headings and structure}
	\item \textbf{Lists and tables}
	\item \textbf{Links and form controls}
	\item \textbf{Alternative text for images}
	\item \textbf{Keyboard navigation}
\end{itemize}

\section{~~Microsoft Word and Google Docs}\label{ch15:sec:word-docs}
\index{office suite!Microsoft Office}
\index{office suite!Google Workspace}

\subsection{Document Structure}\label{ch15:ssec:doc-structure}

\subsubsection{Headings}\label{ch15:sssec:headings}
Use built-in heading styles (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) to create a logical document structure. This allows screen reader users to navigate the document by section.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Word}\label{ch15:sssec:word-headings}
Apply heading styles from the "Styles" pane on the "Home" tab. Use the "Navigation Pane" to view the document outline. This practice is essential for accessibility, as it allows screen readers to generate a navigable outline of the document, enabling users to jump between sections efficiently \supercite{MicrosoftAccessibility}.

\subsubsection{Google Docs}\label{ch15:sssec:docs-headings}
Apply heading styles from the "Styles" dropdown menu in the toolbar. Use "View > Show document outline" to see the structure. Consistent use of headings helps screen reader users understand the document's hierarchy and locate information quickly \supercite{GoogleAccessibility}.

\subsubsection{Lists}\label{ch15:sssec:lists}
Use the built-in tools for creating numbered and bulleted lists. This ensures that screen readers announce the list structure correctly.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Word}\label{ch15:sssec:word-lists}
Use the "Bullets" and "Numbering" buttons in the "Paragraph" group on the "Home" tab. Avoid manually creating lists with asterisks or numbers, as screen readers will not recognize them as structured lists.

\subsubsection{Google Docs}\label{ch15:sssec:docs-lists}
Use the "Numbered list" and "Bulleted list" buttons in the toolbar. Properly formatted lists are announced with item counts, which provides important context for screen reader users.

\subsubsection{Page Layout}\label{ch15:sssec:page-layout}
Use columns and page breaks correctly. Avoid using text boxes or frames for layout, as they can disrupt the reading order for screen readers.

\subsubsection{Both platforms}\label{ch15:sssec:layout-both}
Use the "Columns" feature under the "Layout" tab (Word) or "Format" menu (Docs). Insert page breaks instead of pressing "Enter" multiple times to ensure a clean document structure and predictable navigation for screen readers.

\subsection{Text Formatting}\label{ch15:ssec:text-formatting}

\subsubsection{Font and Color}\label{ch15:sssec:font-color}
Use clear, legible fonts and sufficient color contrast.

\subsubsection{Best practices for both platforms}\label{ch15:sssec:font-color-both}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use sans-serif fonts like Arial or Verdana, with a minimum size of 12 points.
	\item Ensure a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text \supercite{WCAG2018}.
	\item Do not use color as the only means of conveying information. Use other cues like bolding or asterisks.
	\item Use tools like the "Colour Contrast Analyser" to check for compliance \supercite{TGPiCCA}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Links}\label{ch15:sssec:links}
Write descriptive link text that makes sense out of context.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Word}\label{ch15:sssec:word-links}
Right-click selected text and choose "Link" to insert a hyperlink. The "Text to display" field should be descriptive (e.g., "Microsoft Accessibility Guidelines" instead of "click here").

\subsubsection{Google Docs}\label{ch15:sssec:docs-links}
Select text and use the "Insert link" button or \texttt{Ctrl+K}. Descriptive links help screen reader users understand the destination of the link without needing to read the surrounding text.

\subsection{Images and Media}\label{ch15:ssec:images-media}

\subsubsection{Alternative Text}\label{ch15:sssec:alt-text}
Provide concise, descriptive alternative text (alt text) for all images.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Word}\label{ch15:sssec:word-alt-text}
Right-click an image, select "Edit Alt Text," and enter a description. If the image is purely decorative, mark it as such. Alt text should convey the content and function of the image.

\subsubsection{Google Docs}\label{ch15:sssec:docs-alt-text}
Right-click an image, select "Alt text," and provide a description. For complex images, a brief description can be provided in the alt text, with a longer description in the main body of the document.

\subsubsection{Complex Images}\label{ch15:sssec:complex-images}
For charts, graphs, or detailed images, provide a detailed description in the text.

\subsubsection{For charts, graphs, or detailed images}\label{ch15:sssec:charts-etc}
Provide a detailed description in the document text immediately following the image. This ensures that all users have access to the information presented in the image.

\subsection{Tables}\label{ch15:ssec:tables}

\subsubsection{Table Structure}\label{ch15:sssec:table-structure}
Use simple table structures with clear header rows.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Word}\label{ch15:sssec:word-tables}
In "Table Properties," specify a header row and ensure it repeats across pages. This allows screen readers to announce the column headers as users navigate the table, providing context for the data in each cell.

\subsubsection{Google Docs}\label{ch15:sssec:docs-tables}
While Google Docs has limited table accessibility features, using the first row as a header and keeping the structure simple is a best practice. Avoid merged cells or complex layouts that can confuse screen readers.

\subsubsection{Table Accessibility}\label{ch15:sssec:table-accessibility}
Ensure tables are used for data, not layout.

\subsubsection{Both platforms}\label{ch15:sssec:tables-both}
Use tables for presenting tabular data only. Do not use them for visual layout, as this can create a confusing reading order for screen reader users.

\subsection{Navigation Features}\label{ch15:ssec:nav-features}

\subsubsection{Table of Contents}\label{ch15:sssec:toc}
Generate an automatic table of contents.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Word}\label{ch15:sssec:word-toc}
Use "References > Table of Contents" to insert an automatic TOC based on heading styles. This creates a navigable structure that is highly beneficial for screen reader users.

\subsubsection{Google Docs}\label{ch15:sssec:docs-toc}
Use "Insert > Table of Contents." An automated TOC ensures that it stays up-to-date as the document is edited and provides direct links to different sections.

\subsubsection{Bookmarks and Cross-References}\label{ch15:sssec:bookmarks-cross-refs}
Use bookmarks and cross-references for internal navigation.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Word}\label{ch15:sssec:word-bookmarks}
Use the "Bookmark" feature under the "Insert" tab to mark locations and "Cross-reference" under "References" to link to them.

\subsubsection{Google Docs}\label{ch15:sssec:docs-bookmarks}
Use "Insert > Bookmark" to create links to specific points in the document, which improves navigation for all users.

\section{~~Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets}\label{ch15:sec:excel-sheets}
\index{office suite!Microsoft Office}
\index{office suite!Google Workspace}

\subsection{Worksheet Organization}\label{ch15:ssec:worksheet-org}

\subsubsection{Sheet Structure}\label{ch15:sssec:sheet-structure}
Give each worksheet a unique, descriptive name.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Excel}\label{ch15:sssec:excel-sheet-structure}
Right-click the sheet tab and select "Rename." Clear titles like "Q3 Sales Data" are more informative than "Sheet1." This helps users understand the purpose of each sheet without having to inspect its content.

\subsubsection{Google Sheets}\label{ch15:sssec:sheets-sheet-structure}
Double-click the sheet name to edit it. Meaningful names are crucial for navigating complex workbooks, especially for users of assistive technologies.

\subsubsection{Cell Organization}\label{ch15:sssec:cell-org}
Avoid blank rows or columns for formatting.

\subsubsection{Both platforms}\label{ch15:sssec:cell-org-both}
Use cell padding and borders for visual separation instead of empty rows or columns. This ensures that screen readers can correctly interpret data ranges and not announce empty cells unnecessarily.

\subsection{Data Tables}\label{ch15:ssec:data-tables}

\subsubsection{Headers and Labels}\label{ch15:sssec:headers-labels}
Clearly label headers for all data tables.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Excel}\label{ch15:sssec:excel-headers-labels}
Use the "Format as Table" feature on the "Home" tab and ensure the "My table has headers" box is checked. This defines a clear relationship between headers and data cells for screen readers.

\subsubsection{Google Sheets}\label{ch15:sssec:sheets-headers-labels}
Freeze header rows using "View > Freeze > 1 row." While not as robust as Excel's table feature, this helps keep headers visible and provides some context for screen reader users.

\subsubsection{Data Organization}\label{ch15:sssec:data-org}
Keep tables simple and avoid merged cells.

\subsubsection{Best practices}\label{ch15:sssec:data-org-best-practices}
Merged cells can disrupt navigation and make it difficult for screen readers to interpret table structure. It is better to use alternative formatting options to achieve the desired visual layout.

\subsection{Formulas and Functions}\label{ch15:ssec:formulas-functions}

\subsubsection{Formula Accessibility}\label{ch15:sssec:formula-accessibility}
Add comments to explain complex formulas.

\subsubsection{Both platforms}\label{ch15:sssec:formula-accessibility-both}
Right-click a cell and add a comment or note explaining the purpose of a complex formula. This is especially helpful for users who may not be able to easily parse the formula itself.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Excel}\label{ch15:sssec:excel-formulas}
Use named ranges to make formulas more readable (e.g., `=SUM(SalesTotal)` instead of `=SUM(C2:C50)`).

\subsubsection{Google Sheets}\label{ch15:sssec:sheets-formulas}
Named ranges are also available in Google Sheets and serve the same purpose of making formulas more understandable and easier to manage.

\subsection{Charts and Graphs}\label{ch15:ssec:charts-graphs}

\subsubsection{Chart Accessibility}\label{ch15:sssec:chart-accessibility}
Provide alt text and a data table for charts.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Excel}\label{ch15:sssec:excel-charts}
Add alt text to charts to describe their purpose and key takeaways. Additionally, include the underlying data table in the worksheet to provide direct access to the information for screen reader users \supercite{MicrosoftAccessibility}.

\subsubsection{Google Sheets}\label{ch15:sssec:sheets-charts}
Google Sheets has limited accessibility features for charts. It is essential to provide a text description of the chart's meaning and include the data in a separate, accessible table \supercite{GoogleAccessibility}.

\subsubsection{Alternative Formats}\label{ch15:sssec:alt-formats}
For complex charts, provide the data in an alternative format.

\subsubsection{For complex charts}\label{ch15:sssec:complex-charts-alt}
For complex charts, providing the data in a simple, well-structured table is the most effective way to ensure accessibility for all users.

\section{~~Microsoft PowerPoint and Google Slides}\label{ch15:sec:ppt-slides}
\index{office suite!Microsoft Office}
\index{office suite!Google Workspace}

\subsection{Slide Structure}\label{ch15:ssec:slide-structure}

\subsubsection{Slide Layouts}\label{ch15:sssec:slide-layouts}
Use built-in slide layouts to ensure a logical reading order.

\subsubsection{Microsoft PowerPoint}\label{ch15:sssec:ppt-layouts}
Choose from the predefined layouts under "Home > New Slide." These layouts have a built-in reading order that screen readers can follow. Avoid adding text boxes manually, as they can disrupt this order.

\subsubsection{Google Slides}\label{ch15:sssec:slides-layouts}
Apply a layout from the "Layout" menu. Using standard layouts ensures that content is presented in a predictable and accessible manner for screen reader users.

\subsubsection{Reading Order}\label{ch15:sssec:reading-order}
Check and adjust the reading order of slide elements.

\subsubsection{Both platforms}\label{ch15:sssec:reading-order-both}
In PowerPoint, use the "Selection Pane" to view and reorder objects. In Google Slides, the reading order is generally determined by the order in which objects are added, so careful construction is key.

\subsection{Content Organization}\label{ch15:ssec:content-org}

\subsubsection{Slide Titles}\label{ch15:sssec:slide-titles}
Ensure every slide has a unique, descriptive title.

\subsubsection{Microsoft PowerPoint}\label{ch15:sssec:ppt-titles}
Use the title placeholder in the slide layout. If a slide does not need a visible title, you can move the placeholder off-screen, but do not delete it, as screen readers use it for navigation.

\subsubsection{Google Slides}\label{ch15:sssec:slides-titles}
Like PowerPoint, every slide should have a unique title. This is the primary way screen reader users navigate a presentation, allowing them to quickly find specific slides.

\subsubsection{Text Content}\label{ch15:sssec:text-content}
Keep text concise and use simple language.

\subsubsection{Best practices}\label{ch15:sssec:text-content-best-practices}
Use bullet points to break up information into digestible chunks. Aim for high contrast between text and background, and use a font size of at least 18 points for body text.

\subsection{Images and Media}\label{ch15:ssec:images-media-slides}

\subsubsection{Alternative Text}\label{ch15:sssec:alt-text-slides}
Provide alt text for all images and visual elements.

\subsubsection{Microsoft PowerPoint}\label{ch15:sssec:ppt-alt-text}
Right-click an image and select "Edit Alt Text." As with Word, mark decorative images as such to prevent unnecessary announcements by screen readers.

\subsubsection{Google Slides}\label{ch15:sssec:slides-alt-text}
Right-click an image and select "Alt text." A good description conveys the essential information of the image without being overly verbose.

\subsubsection{Video and Audio}\label{ch15:sssec:video-audio}
Provide captions for videos and transcripts for audio.

\subsubsection{Accessibility considerations}\label{ch15:sssec:video-audio-a11y}
Ensure that multimedia content is accessible. This includes synchronized captions for videos and full transcripts for audio-only content. These accommodations are essential for users with hearing impairments.

\subsection{Animations and Transitions}\label{ch15:ssec:animations-transitions}

\subsubsection{Animation Guidelines}\label{ch15:sssec:animation-guidelines}
Use animations and transitions sparingly.

\subsubsection{Both platforms}\label{ch15:sssec:animations-both}
While animations can be visually engaging, they can be distracting or confusing for some users. If used, ensure they do not convey essential information and are simple and brief.

\subsection{Speaker Notes}\label{ch15:ssec:speaker-notes}

\subsubsection{Comprehensive Notes}\label{ch15:sssec:comprehensive-notes}
Use speaker notes to provide a detailed script of the presentation.

\subsubsection{Microsoft PowerPoint}\label{ch15:sssec:ppt-speaker-notes}
Add detailed notes in the speaker notes pane. This content can be used as a transcript for the presentation, making it accessible to a wider audience after the live event.

\subsubsection{Google Slides}\label{ch15:sssec:slides-speaker-notes}
The speaker notes section in Google Slides serves the same purpose. Providing detailed notes ensures that the full content of the presentation is available in a text-based format.

\section{~~General Best Practices}\label{ch15:sec:general-best-practices}

\subsection{Language and Writing}\label{ch15:ssec:language-writing}

\subsubsection{Clear Communication}\label{ch15:sssec:clear-communication}
Write in plain language, avoiding jargon and complex sentences. Define acronyms on their first use. This improves comprehension for everyone, including people with cognitive disabilities and non-native speakers.

\subsubsection{Document Properties}\label{ch15:sssec:doc-properties}
Set the document title and language.

\subsubsection{Microsoft Office}\label{ch15:sssec:office-doc-properties}
Go to "File > Info" to set the document title in the "Properties" section. This title is often the first thing a screen reader announces, so it should be descriptive.

\subsubsection{Google Workspace}\label{ch15:sssec:google-doc-properties}
Set the document language under "File > Language." This ensures that screen readers use the correct pronunciation and accent for the text.

\subsection{File Management}\label{ch15:ssec:file-management}

\subsubsection{File Naming}\label{ch15:sssec:file-naming}
