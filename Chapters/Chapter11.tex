\section{~~Introduction}\label{ch11:sec:introduction}
\subsection{The Imperative of Accessible Mathematical and Scientific Content}\label{ch11:ssec:imperative}
The increasing digitalization of educational materials necessitates a strong focus on accessibility\index{accessibility}, particularly for complex content like mathematics. Ensuring mathematical content is accessible is a legal requirement under mandates such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)\index{accessibility!legal accessibility!ADA} and a critical component of educational equity\index{equitable access}. Students with visual impairments and other learning challenges often face significant barriers when interacting with traditional math formats, which frequently embed equations as inaccessible static images \supercite{UWAccessibleMath, ChallengesForVisuallyImpairedUsers}. This "accessibility gap" hinders comprehension and participation, making robust technological solutions essential.

\subsection{Foundational Accessibility Standards: MathML and WCAG}\label{ch11:ssec:standards}
\textbf{\gls{MathML} (Mathematical Markup Language)}\index{MathML} is the W3C\index{organizations!W3C} standard for displaying mathematical content on the web. As an \gls{XML}-based language, it encodes both the presentation and the semantic meaning of an equation, allowing assistive technologies like screen readers\index{screen reader} to interpret and voice the content correctly \supercite{W3CMathML, W3CMathML3, W3CMathML4}. This is a crucial advantage over \gls{LateX}\index{LaTeX}, which is designed for visual typesetting and is not natively accessible without conversion to \gls{MathML}, often via a library like MathJax\index{software!math rendering!MathJax} \supercite{MathJax, LaTeXProject}.

\textbf{\gls{WCAG} (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines)}\index{WCAG} provide a framework for creating accessible web content. Tools for accessible math, both commercial and open-source, often adhere to \gls{WCAG} standards to ensure their interfaces and outputs are usable by people with disabilities \supercite{WCAG20, WCAG21W3C2018}.

\subsection{Overview of Math OCR and AI in Accessibility}\label{ch11:ssec:math-ocr-ai}
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is the technology used to convert images of text into machine-readable text data \supercite{AdobeOCR, ContinualEngineOCR}. Mathematical Optical Character Recognition (\gls{mathOCR})\index{Optical Character Recognition (OCR)!mathematical} is a specialized technology that digitizes mathematical expressions from images and PDFs. Unlike standard \gls{OCR}, \gls{mathOCR} must interpret the complex two-dimensional structure of equations. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (\gls{AI})\index{AI}, particularly deep learning\index{AI!deep learning}, has significantly advanced \gls{mathOCR}, enabling it to recognize even handwritten or poorly formatted equations with high accuracy \supercite{AIinOCR, DeepLearningOCROverview, ArxivMER2103}. Tools like Marker\index{software!document conversion!Marker} are at the forefront, converting unstructured documents into clean, accessible markup like \gls{LateX} and \gls{MathML} \supercite{Marker, MarkerDocs}.

\section{~~Advancements in AI-Powered Math OCR}\label{ch11:sec:ai-ocr-advancements}
\subsection{Core Technologies and Deep Learning Architectures}\label{ch11:ssec:core-tech}
Modern \gls{mathOCR} systems utilize deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\index{AI!deep learning!CNN} for symbol recognition and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\index{AI!deep learning!RNN} or Transformers\index{AI!deep learning!Transformers} for analyzing the spatial relationships between symbols. These models are trained on vast datasets of mathematical expressions to achieve high accuracy \supercite{ArxivMER2203, ArxivMER2303}.

\subsection{Challenges and Solutions in Mathematical Expression Recognition}\label{ch11:ssec:challenges}
Recognizing mathematical expressions is challenging due to the large number of symbols, complex 2D layouts, and ambiguity (e.g., a horizontal line could be a fraction bar or a minus sign). \gls{AI}-powered systems address this by learning the contextual rules of mathematical notation from data, rather than relying on hand-coded rules \supercite{ResearchGateMathSVM, WorldScientificMathOCR}.

\subsection{Semantic Enrichment for Enhanced Accessibility}\label{ch11:ssec:semantic-enrichment}
The most advanced systems do not just recognize symbols; they parse the mathematical structure to generate semantically rich output like \gls{MathML}\index{MathML!semantic}. This means the output understands that $\frac{a}{b}$ is a fraction with a numerator $a$ and a denominator $b$, which is crucial for intelligent navigation by screen readers \supercite{IBMSemanticAI, OntotextSemanticAI}.

\section{~~The Role of Marker and Similar Tools in Math OCR Workflows}\label{ch11:sec:marker}

\subsection{Integration with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Accuracy}\label{ch11:ssec:marker-llm}
Marker can optionally use Large Language Models (\gls{LLM})\index{AI!LLM} to improve the quality of its output, such as fixing \gls{OCR} errors or improving text flow. This combination of deep learning for layout detection and \gls{LLM}s for content refinement represents the state-of-the-art in document conversion \supercite{MarkerDocs}.

\subsection{Practical Workflows for LaTeX and MathML Output}\label{ch11:ssec:marker-workflows}
A typical workflow for making a legacy PDF accessible involves:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Processing the PDF with Marker to convert it to a Markdown file with \gls{LateX} equations.
	\item Reviewing the generated Markdown for any \gls{OCR} errors.
	\item Using a tool like Pandoc\index{software!document conversion!Pandoc} to convert the Markdown file into an accessible HTML file, where the \gls{LateX} is automatically rendered as \gls{MathML} by a library like MathJax\index{software!math rendering!MathJax} \supercite{PandocDocs}.
\end{enumerate}
