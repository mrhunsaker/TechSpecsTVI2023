The Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEIA) 2004 mandates that students with disabilities receive a free and appropriate public education (FAPE) in the least restrictive environment possible\footnote{\raggedright 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq. (2004)}. To ensure that blind and low vision students have access to FAPE, there is a need for evidence-based specialized curriculum to teach screenreader usage, magnification usage, accessible typing programs, and accessible coding curricula to teach tech skills to blind/low vision students.

Screen readers are software programs that allow blind and visually impaired users to read the text that is displayed on a computer screen with a speech synthesizer or braille display\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://www.pathstoliteracy.org/resource/introduction-screen-reader-instruction/}{Paths to Literacy. (n.d.). Introduction to Screen Reader Instruction. Retrieved January 8, 2024} \break\url{https://www.pathstoliteracy.org/resource/introduction-screen-reader-instruction/}}. Magnification software enlarges the text and images on the screen for low vision users\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-videos/magnification-software}{American Foundation for the Blind. (n.d.). Magnification Software. Retrieved January 8, 2024} \url{https://www.afb.org/blindness-and-low-vision/using-technology/assistive-technology-videos/magnification-software}}. Accessible typing programs help students with disabilities learn to type using adaptive technology. Accessible coding curricula teach blind and low vision students how to code using specialized software that is designed to be accessible to them\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/helping-blind-people-learn-to-code-c47c68d4a237/}{FreeCodeCamp.org (2018). Helping blind people learn to code. Retrieved January 8, 2024} \break\url{https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/helping-blind-people-learn-to-code-c47c68d4a237/}}.

Evidence-based specialized curriculum for teaching these skills is important because it ensures that students with disabilities have access to the same educational opportunities as their peers. It also helps to ensure that students with disabilities are able to develop the skills they need to succeed in the workforce. By providing students with disabilities with the tools they need to succeed, we can help to create a more inclusive society where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential.

You may be thinking: My blind child has a Braille device. Why does she need to learn to type?

Even if your child has a Braille device such as the Braillenote Touch, typing is essential. The computer is the mainstream device that your child will need in order to be productive in school and in the workplace. When I meet a new blind student, parents often tell me, "My child needs to learn to use a screen reader." The first question I ask is, "Does your child know how to type?" In order to use a screen reader such as JAWS effectively, you have to be able to type accurately. Braille is important, too, and it definitely has its uses in technology. But I believe that typing is as important as Braille.

Typing allows blind students to use mainstream devices. They can use a laptop or desktop computer, or they can connect a keyboard to a tablet. When I use my iPhone and type in text messages, my keyboarding skills help me use the screen, even without a Braille display.

Bureau of Internet Accessibility.}  \break\url{https://www.boia.org/blog/google-talkback-an-overview-of-androids-free-screen-reader}}. Both screen readers include gesture-based controls and braille keyboard support 1. While these screen readers are useful tools, they depend on accurate text alternatives for non-text content. Learning VoiceOver and TalkBack gestures can help users navigate their devices more efficiently and effectively. For instance, TalkBack gestures can help users navigate and perform frequent actions on their Android devices, such as moving to the next item on the screen, selecting an item, and activating screen search.\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6151827?hl=en}{Google. (n.d.). Use TalkBack on your Android device. Google. } \break\url{https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/6151827?hl=en}} Similarly, VoiceOver gestures can help users navigate and perform frequent actions on their Apple devices, such as opening the app switcher, accessing the control center, and activating Siri Competency with VoiceOver and TalkBack gestures can enable users to access the same activities as their peers, manage eye fatigue, and use good posture and a good viewing distance.

Learning advanced methods of navigating the computer with a screen reader such as JAWS, Windows Narrator, or NVDA is essential for users with visual impairments. While arrow keys and Tab can be useful for basic navigation, advanced methods can provide more efficient and comprehensive navigation. For instance, JAWS provides a feature called “Virtual Cursor” that allows users to navigate web pages and documents by line, word, character, or even by paragraph\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws}{Freedom Scientific. (n.d.). JAWS Screen Reader. Freedom Scientific.} \break\url{https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws}}. Similarly, Windows Narrator provides a feature called “Scan Mode” that allows users to navigate web pages and documents by headings, links, tables, and landmarks.\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/narrator-user-guide-4b2e6b3f-1d6d-8a5c-4f6d2a3b3d6f}{Microsoft.

\pagebreak\hypertarget{appx10}{}\section[Braille Display Use]{Braille Display Use}\label{appx10}
Learning how to use a refreshable braille display is essential for emerging braille readers. Refreshable Braille Displays are peripheral devices that display braille characters, usually by raising and lowering dots through holes in a flat surface. Users can input braille using either the 6 or 8 key Perkins-style braille keyboard or, more recently, a QWERTY keyboard.  While it may be tempting to use only the minimum functions of an braille display, being explicitly taught how to use it can provide many benefits. For instance, it can help improve finger strength and isolated finger control, which are crucial for writing\footnote{\raggedright \href{https://www.perkins.org/resource/benefits-using-braille-display-emerging-readers/}{Perkins School for the Blind. (n.d.). Benefits of Using a Braille Display with Emerging Readers. Retrieved January 8, 2024} \url{https://www.perkins.org/resource/benefits-using-braille-display-emerging-readers/}}. Additionally, using an braille display can help emerging readers with tactile discrimination and make it easier to read. Furthermore, pairing an braille display with a computer, tablet, or smartphone can provide instant auditory feedback as the student types, which can help with motivation.
