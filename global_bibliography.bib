This is especially the case of persons with disabilities, such as visually impaired people. Unfortunately, very few games are accessible to such persons. Hopefully, in many digital games, this accessibility can be enabled in principle by assistive technologies, such as screen readers. The aim of this work consists in reviewing the recent literature on game accessibility for people with visual impairment and discussing benefits, limitations, and possible improvements of currently available accessibility solutions. After providing a definition of visual impairment and describing its relationship with gaming, the work reviews general techniques for designing more accessible games. Subsequently, it focuses on specific techniques based on replacing visual stimuli with auditory stimuli (e.g., sonification and sound-source simulation), also presenting some recently proposed sonification-mapping strategies. Then, the application of machine-learning techniques to the development of accessible interfaces for online versions of board games is illustrated by a recent case study. Finally, a discussion and some conclusions are provided, with a particular focus on policy implications of improvements in game accessibility for visually impaired people.}, journal = {Soft Comput.}, month = jul, pages = {10475–10489}, numpages = {15}, keywords = {Visual impairment, Games, Accessibility, Sensory substitution, Machine learning}}
